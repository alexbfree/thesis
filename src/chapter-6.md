Reclaiming Power in Practice {#chapter-6}
=======================
[Target 7,500 words]

This chapter will focus on the practicalities of trying to effect change, through the lenses of :
- the work done with SILVER developing a health data interface
- the exploration of shifting the locus of decision making (from chapter 5)
- the work done with the BBC designing and prototyping personal data store interfaces and data models
- the individual prototyping work I have done
  - web augmentation / Facebook post gathering
  - web augmentation / Just Eat
  - scripts analysing GDPR-retrieved Data
  - Gmail API hacking
  - life data models and abstract data models from the BBC

It is largely discursive as a chapter, putting forward my own ideas but informed by all the practical work I have done throughout the PhD

Barriers and Realities of Trying to Effect change
----------
[Target X words]

### SILVER project
[Target X words]

What we did and didn't achieve in building a health data interface. Including critique of the project's positioning as "a staff data interface is the answer" and the challenges of building for a dynamically changing, messy, secretive, proprietary world of interconnected systems and changing standards.

#### Notes
This could become a more general section on "building data interfaces" incorporating some learnings from BBC. not sure if that is best place for this.

### The Power of Data holders
[Target X words]

Starting by looking at idea of shifting the locus of decision Making, linked into the context of chapter 5 (referencing models of power) then moving into the ways in which organisations maintain power today (closed databases - care side, removing the seams and limiting data access and use, non-interoperability etc - commercial side). What are the practical ways to challenge this - web augmentation, GDPR-based relentless pressure>dashboards, etc.
Personal data stores as solution - huge challenges of building and designing, need to model for everyday life, hard to codify life.

### Levels of Access to Data - GDPR critique
[Target X words]

My analysis of the effectiveness of GDPR and how i position it as a better-than-it-was but not-good-enough level of access - introduce my model for access

### Recommendations for future study
[Target X words]

Bringing the chapter to a close by recommending the key *practical* ways forward that have the best hope of effecting change.
