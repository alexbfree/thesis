### Personal motivations and context

This PhD and this thesis represent the culmination of a passion to get more value from our computers that has been with me for over 25 years. I learned from an early age about computers by programming my Acorn Electron, one of the many 1980s home computers that taught their users that the computer was a tool to be exploited, that you could master it and make it do what you wanted it to. In my formative years at University and beyond, I lived through the birth of the public Internet and marvelled at the ability for computers to connect people across the world and transform the way people interact. Keenly tracking the Web 2.0 revolution and the digitisation and disruption of so many industries since the start of the 21st century and embracing new capabilities, I became fascinated with the ways in which humans were shaping computer systems which in turn were shaping us. As a graduate software engineer at IBM in the 2000s, I podcasted about new ways to be more productive with computers, and participated in an innovation club with colleagues imagining new ways to relate to digital information. I gradually moved from back-end development, to front-end development to user experience, getting closer to a place where I could help end users benefit from technology. From 2009-2011, while working in Canadian startups, I founded and was a lead writer on a blog called Human 2.0[^1], examining the inter-relationship between society and emerging technology. I was witness to a changing world, where we were gaining new capabilities, but also, through the digitalisation of businesses and the shift to data-centric cloud-centric business models, losing our agency to harness computers for our own ends. I presented my developing ideas for better human data interaction four times at Bitnorth conferences[^2]. During this time I had essays published at O'Reilly Radar[@bowyer2011] and in print [@bowyer2012]. Despite seeing further potential for smarter, more helpful computer systems through my participation in the Semantic Web community and being a senior developer of semantic text analysis software at Open Text, by 2014 it was beyond doubt to me that the software industry had lost its way, prioritising business goals over user agency, reducing features and creating technology designed to limit and corral users to behave in certain ways. Against a backdrop of a social media revolution which was literally breaking society and democracy to further the pursuit of profit [@tufekci2017;@hall2018], I took the leap to escape corporate IT and seek ways to research, design and help to build a better digital future, to make computers useful again. This led me, via a web science architect position at citizen science platform Zooniverse that gave further understanding of user motivations, to join the Digital Civics CDT programme [@digitalCivicsCDT2018], where I was finally able to work on this most important of problems. It has been a tremendous privilege to spend six years understanding in great detail the nature of the problems facing our data-centric society, and to be able to map out the landscape for improving the way we relate to data. As well as the ability to find grounded evidence to quantify and qualify the losses of agency I had observed and theorised, this gave me space to experiment with using using GDPR to access data and push boundaries, and to design and prototype new views of data. Looking forward, this opportunity has opened doors that have enabled me to begin to put these learnings into action, working on important projects with Connected Health Cities, BBC R&D, and Hestia.ai to explore how data interaction reforms can be realised in practice, and how we can come not just innovators but social data activists to begin to have an impact and to build that better future. It is the journey of a lifetime, and also one that is in many ways just beginning. I hope that my work and this thesis can, in some small way, contribute to a better, more human-centric digital world, and I can't wait to see where this leads.

### Pilot Study

My Doctoral Training programme at Open Lab began with a Masters in Research in Digital Civics. For my MRes project[^3], I conducted a pilot study, interviewing and exploring issues around data with families who had experience of social care services. During the first months of this PhD I conducted new analysis of the data collected, resulting in the synthesis into a full first-author paper published at CHI 2018:

- "[Understanding the Family Perspective on the Storage Sharing and Handling of Family Civic Data](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3173574.3173710)" [@bowyer2018b]

This study is given a special status in this thesis; while it is not officially to be examined, it plays a critical role as a pilot study for Case Study One and its findings and insights are built upon in Chapters 4, 6 and 7. As such, the paper is included in full in Appendix 1.[ADD APPENDIX REFERENCE]

[^3]: MRes result awarded: Distinction.

### Primary Case studies

#### Publications from Case Study One

The work carried out in Case Study One has been initially published as an Extended Abstract at CHI 2019:

- "[Human-data interaction in the context of care: Co-designing family civic data interfaces and practices](https://doi.org/10.1145/3290607.3312998)" [@bowyer2019]

This work was also presented at the conference in the form of a poster, which is shown in Figure X.

A 15,000 word+ detailed first-author journal paper has been drafted to supplement the extended abstract and will be submitted for publication in due course.

#### Publication from Case Study Two

The work carried out in Case Study Two has been published as a full first-author paper at CHI 2022:

- ["Human-GDPR Interaction: Practical Experiences of Accessing Personal Data"](https://doi.org/10.1145/3491102.3501947) [@bowyer2022].

I carried out all field research myself. Data analysis and paper writing was shared between myself and Jack Holt.

### Workshop papers & presentations

During the PhD, I gave a number of presentations and published three workshop papers which included material from, or directly contributing to, this thesis and helped shape the ways in which I express the arguments within:

- ["Designing For Human Autonomy: The next challenge that civic HCI must address"](https://eprints.ncl.ac.uk/273832) - a short talk I presented to my peers in January 2017 laying out the landscape of reduced agency and possible avenues for improving humans' relationships to their data.
- ["Free Data Interfaces: Taking Human-Data Interaction to the Next Level"](https://eprints.ncl.ac.uk/273825) - a CHI 2018 workshop paper formalising past pre-PhD design thinking and outlining a vision for unconstrained and useful data interaction interfaces
- ["A Grand Vision for Post-Capitalist HCI: Digital Life Assistants"](https://eprints.ncl.ac.uk/273826) - a CHI 2018 workshop paper where I imagined a form of digital computer assistant that is far more helpful and human-data-centric than the digital voice assistants of today.
- ["Personal Data Use: A Human-centric Perspective"](https://eprints.ncl.ac.uk/273834) - in early 2020 just prior to the pandemic, I was invited to give a lecture on my research to undergraduate students at both Northumbria University and Newcastle University.
- ["My Thesis in 3 Minutes: Understanding and Designing Human Data Relations"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFHXc_TfM5c) - in April 2021, I presented my thesis in the 3 minute thesis competition, and was co-winner of the people's choice prize.
- ["Human-Data Interaction has two purposes: Personal Data Control and Life Information Exploration"](https://eprints.ncl.ac.uk/274297) - A workshop paper I presented at CHI 2021, where I first outlined my model of the two motivating factors for interacting with personal data.

### Publications from other work

During the same timeframe as this PhD, I have also contributed to a number of publications tangential to my primary research agenda:

- As a researcher and developer on the Connected Health Cities SILVER project [ADD REF TO 3.x], I contributed to work published through Newcastle University's internal report to CHC (not publicly available) and the [overall impact report](https://web.archive.org/web/20211225192408/https://www.chc-impact-report.co.uk/) (p129-130), and more directly published [demonstration videos](https://eprints.ncl.ac.uk/273839) of a health data interface prototype developed by myself and Stuart Wheater.
- As a researcher and developer on DERC's Healthy Eating project, I developed interface prototypes (no longer online) and was co-author to two research publications [at BCS 2021](https://doi.org/10.14236/ewic/HCI2021.16) [@goffe2021] and [in Interacting with Computers](https://doi.org/10.1093/iwc/iwac015) [@goffe2022].
- As a research intern on BBC R&D's Cornmarket project [ADD REF], I published an internal research report[ADD REF] into personal data store design, as well as a 'stimulus presentation' to launch an internal hack week and a BBC blog article about the work (which was not officially published) [ADD REF].
- As a project leader, data access coach and researcher at Hestia.ai, I was a lead author on [a research report auditing the data economy](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6554177), and co-author on [a research report on power mechanisms in the data economy](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6554155).
