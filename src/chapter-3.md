The previous chapter described the two research areas this thesis seeks to explore: how people think about data and what they want from it; and the role data takes and should take in people's relationships with organisations. This chapter will explain this PhD's approach to conducting research in this area, detailing the types of methods used, and explaining how the different research activities carried out contribute to the research objectives.

Forming a Research Paradigm: Ontology & Epistemology{#3.1}
----------------------------------------------------

To develop a research paradigm, one must reflect on two things [@guba1990]:

 - _ontology_: your outlook on the nature of reality, and
 - _epistemology_: your beliefs on how knowledge of that reality is formed.

It will already be evident to the reader that individual human experience is at the forefront of my thinking. I believe that everyone experiences their own reality, informed by their own concepts and mental models of the world. This ontological stance, known as _constructivism_ [@guba1990] argues new knowledge is formed by developing one's own mental models in order to explain new experiences, as distinct from the positivist view that there is a single universal reality one can uncover. In today's rapidly evolving technological landscape, people have no choice but to develop new mental models to make sense of new concepts such as _posts_,  _feeds_, _link sharing_, _syncing_ and _blocking_, in order that we might find value in them.

This idea that reality is constantly renegotiated by the individual is known as _pragmatism_ [@campbell2011]. People's developing conceptions of reality are not purely an intellectual endeavour though; As _Deweyan pragmatism_ states, our knowledge and thinking are tested by actions, not just reason, and that this is how we learn. Communication and interaction with others are key parts of that learning. Dewey recognises that every individual is not solitary, he exists within a society as 'a social being, a citizen, growing and thinking in a vast complex of interactions and relationships' [@dewey1974]. People create systems and meanings through those interpersonal interactions—which they can then use to understand everyday life. This is particularly important in the social world, as unlike the physical, natural world, many concepts are abstract and subject to individual interpretation. This drives my research motivation to understanding how people make sense of their world, and how that changes as a result of their lived experience.

Constructivists tend to believe that people are motivated by a desire to solve problems combined with a confidence to learn [@prawat1994]. In this regard, I look beyond traditional constructivism, as I think _individualism_ [@britannicaIndividualism] offers a better explanation. Much though we might not like it to be the case, people are self-interested, pursuing their own individual happiness and wellbeing, and it is this self-interest is what drives the pursuit of deeper knowledge and understanding about the world. In essence, everyone wants to improve their own life, and they need to acquire knowledge about how the world works so that they might be able to change it. This path of acquiring and sharing individual understandings about the world, which can then be used to effect change upon the world, is a key driver behind my research. Taken further, this can be seen as _civil libertarianism_ [@gulite2014], which argues for the supremacy of individual rights and personal freedoms over imposition by authority. The human-centric movement [[2.3.4](#2.3.4)] clearly subscribes to this philosophy, as do I, and this explains why my research moves from simply understanding the world (in Section II), to functioning as an activist trying to change it (in Section IV).

My established ontological stance, then, is that individuals construct concepts, and continually update them through sensory experience, action, and social interaction. They do this in order to maintain a pragmatic knowledge that they can practically exploit to effect change in society and in the world, in order to pursue their own happiness and self-interest.

Looking to epistemology: how can knowledge be acquired? Constructivism suggests that this is best done not through direct observation of the world and explicit testing of hypothesis, but though interacting and communicating with individuals so that we can interpret how they view reality; this is known as an _interpretivist_ epistemology [@dudovskiy2012]. This motivates my choices to favour _qualitative_ (understanding perspectives and collecting spoken/narrative data) rather than _quantitative_ (measuring behaviours and collecting numerical data) investigation. By understanding people's views and mental models around data and digital living, I can look for commonalities and develop _theories_—powerful explanations that can be understood and benefitted from by ordinary people—to fill the knowledge gaps in existing research that I have identified [[2.4](#2.4)]. Given my pragmatic focus on interpreting people's constructed social realities in terms of practical usefulness (in individualist terms: individual benefit) to them, I will not be deeply analysing their words through language analysis techniques like discourse analysis. I will instead focus on the social, interpersonal level–understanding how people navigate the world of data and data-based relationships. I want to explore how they change their understandings as they pursue their goals in practice, and how they are affected by the systems, relationships and society they exist within. This pragmatic approach and search for commonalities motivates a _mixed methods approach_ [@ukhsa2020], combining qualitative or quantitative methods as appropriate to the particular sub-question being explored.

Thus, my epistemological stance is an interpretive one, that also recognises that in order to identify commonalities and _shared meanings_ [@dudovskiy2012], the researcher must employ a mixture of qualitative and quantitative techniques.

Research Approach{#3.2}
-----------------

### Participatory Co-Design & Experience-centred Design{#3.2.1}

Moving from general research philosophy to specifics of this PhD, I see the purpose of this research as to formulate theories that can facilitate change - to map out a research and development agenda that might help the world to move from a data-centric [[2.1](#2.1)] to a human-centric [[2.3](#2.3)] operating paradigm. Learning about people's understandings of their reality informs and enables an inductive research approach where patterns common to multiple people can be identified to form general understandings of what people _want_<sup>[11](#fn11)</sup> from data, and from those who hold it. Based on the premise of individual betterment laid out above, these desires serve as justification for the thesis to take a moral stance on personal data: That access to data held about you by others is a fundamental right, and that theory and action that can empower individuals to be able to understand and use their data for their own purposes is a fundamental good that will benefit individuals and society at large.

As a student of _Digital Civics_ [@vlachokyriakos2016], I believe that research can surface the ways in which current service provisions fail to meet people's needs, and how the world might better empower citizens if it were configured differently with services closer to what they desire. The role of the researcher is to understand the world and to figure out how to change it. It is an accepted view that research cannot be value-free, but in fact I advocate an even more positional stance: the researcher can be an activist, seeking to correct an imbalance in the world through their research. As such, the design elements of this research can be considered as political. In this thesis, especially Section IV, I embrace _adversarial design_ [@disalvo2012]. I view this as necessary to counterbalance the strong forces outlined in [Chapter 2](#chapter-2) and [Chapter 8](#chapter-8) that are acting against individual interests, and in order to pursue the moral imperative laid out above. By creating space to reveal and confront power relations and influence, we can identify new trajectories for action [@disalvo2010]. Therefore, the purpose of the participatory research carried out through the Case Studies is to inform myself as adversarial designer and activist researcher. Acquired insights from the experiences of research participants can help me to develop my own understanding, models, and theories for change.

When designing for people and trying to incorporate their views, there are traditionally two schools of thought: _user-centred design (UCD)_ and _participatory co-design (PD)_. In UCD, design is carried out by experts, who have undertaken user research to build up understandings of user needs [@norman1986]. This approach places a high value on expertise, but it carries the risk that certain user needs may be overlooked, especially those that are less common (and therefore less likely be present in a designer's concept of 'the average user'). UCD is the most common approach used by technology companies today, not least because commercial motives must be incorporated into designs, and therefore design can never be fully democratised. UCD as implemented in modern software development practice does however recognise the importance of representing the user perspective in the design process, and uses processes such as _focus groups_, _user experience testing_, and _user persona development_ to include their perspectives. However, in a commercial context such perspectives may ultimately be ignored or diluted in favour of expert designs or organisational motives, as observed in [2.4](#2.4).

Recognition of this inherent problem–that users carry less influence than designers and that this imbalance must be tackled head on–lead to the ideas of co-creation (also known as _co-design_) and PD. PD is based upon the idea that those who will use or be affected by technology have a legitimate reason to be involved in its design [@kensing1998]. PD is seen as an attempt to design in a more democratic fashion. PD proponents argue that it is not sufficient to study users and go away and design in isolation. Instead, the users and technologists work together in design workshops, with users bringing their lived experiences and perspectives and technologists bringing their expertise on technical and market possibilities and constraints [@bjorgvinsson2010; @nygaard1987; @smith2017]. In such a collaboration, a collective, democratic design is created, taking into account all perspectives. In the 2000s, PD grew in popularity across public and private sector organisations, coincident with the growth of internet and social media into its _Web 2.0_ phase [@hosch2017] which resurfaced the potential to reframe digital technology as something to be harnessed for users' own ends [@jenkins2006].

As design approaches, I see merit in both UCD and PD. The participant should play a role as an _informant_–one who can provide critical insights into their own perspective on a design space and help us understand how the world is to them–but also as a _designer_–one who can imagine how they would like the world to be. As we involve the participant, our role as researcher is to elicit the richest possible responses from the participant, by using questions to bring them to consider new possibilities and by giving them stimulating materials to trigger their thinking about what they might like to see changed. The researcher also often needs to _sensitise_ the participant to a design space, so that they may properly engage with the questions being posed. Conversely, the researcher cannot arrive at a model or theory unless he has developed _empathy_ for the participant's perspective. One of pragmatism's founding philosophers, Peirce, put forward the _pragmatic maxim_, which states that the meaning of anything we experience in the world is understood through the conception of its practical effect, and that theories that are more successful at controlling and predicting our world can be considered closer to the truth [@campbell2011]. Applying this philosophy to the challenge of design, I find merit in the different, less political, take on involving users as participants in design exhibited in McCarthy and Wright's _experience-centred design_ framework, which identifies processes to improve user empathy including _interpreting_, _reflecting_ and _appropriating_ [@mccarthy2004].

Through this research, I will at times be more participatory, to understand these aspects of user experience or to co-design solutions with participants. I will at other times act more like an expert designer, especially when moving from problem definition to solution-focused design throughout Sections III, IV and V. Taken to the extreme, the PD view is that designs made without the direct involvement of users are invalid, because they inherently no longer represent the desires of those people the designs claim to serve. I oppose this view, because I believe that new ideas will not always arise from participants themselves, especially for this research area–where a more expert-led experience-centred design approach is the most pragmatic way to proceed. By its nature, this research involves thinking about data, information, organisational relations and interaction at a level which the layperson is not accustomed or well-equipped to do. Therefore, while I strive to always include participant viewpoints, I give ultimate precedence in design to my own position of learning that I will acquire through the participatory research as well as peripheral design and development work [[7.2OLD](#7.2OLD)]. In incorporating both approaches, I will also be a participant in my own research, incorporating my own experiences of living in a data-centric world (and my attempts to challenge it) into my learnings.

It is important to be clear about what constitutes good research in this context; if the outcome of the research is to be my own interpretations and theories, how will we know these are sound? First, it is important to say that this is not about measuring the effectiveness of proposed changes upon the world. There will be no deployment of systems to test the ideas I put forward. This is not because such an activity would not be worthwhile—it would—but simply because by its nature, to develop, build and deploy new data interaction paradigms that function in real life with real personal data at the sociotechnical level would be too large an endeavour for a single researcher (or even a single academic research group) to undertake. Therefore, what I seek in this thesis is not to change the world, but to articulate with the greatest possible clarity discrete theories on how the world should, and could, be changed. Good evidence for the proposed changes will be achieved by ensuring that findings, themes and discussion contributions are backed up by participant quotes or extant work and literature, and where an idea is suggested or agreed upon by many participants or where it resonates with the practical experiences of myself or of others, that can be seen as adding weight or validation to that idea. However, each person's experience is unique and needs to be put into context; not every insight will be shared by many participants and individual unique insights remain important.

### A Two-Track Research Approach: Learning and Practice{#3.2.2}

The overall research design for this PhD was informed by two key motives:

  i) the desire to ensure that both PD (participant-driven) and UCD (expert-driven) design approaches contribute to the learning and models produced by this research, and
  ii) the recognition that real-world problems with a lack of agency and negotiability over personal data cannot be fully understood, nor any tangible impact achieved, without embracing the problem space at a sociotechnical level - going beyond understanding the problems, to attempting to actually apply that understanding in practice.

I judged, therefore, that participatory design work needed to be accompanied by practical work in relevant industrial and academic projects that were also attempting to improve people's agency and relationships with data, as well as individual experimentation to familiarise myself with data rights and explore technical possibilities. These grounded efforts would enable learning about the technologies, business processes and market forces affecting the problem space, and would allow theories and models emerging from the theoretical side of the research to be more thoroughly examined from a real-world perspective.

In order to explore the research questions from as many angles as possible, I wanted to design a research approach including three types of activity:

1. _participatory co-design activities_ - where I discuss and explore experiences, challenges and possible solutions with participants through conversations and design activities
2. _self-experimentation activities_ - where I carry out experiments, ranging from thought exercises to practical tests of what is possible, to develop ideas and models and explore the problem and solution spaces myself, and
3. _embedded research activities_ - where I participate as an involved team member, in external organisations' real-world projects that are trying to effect change in the personal data space, in order to learn about the challenges faced and the viability of different approaches, informed by the grounded experience of myself and others. This draws on the concept of embedded research as described in [@cheetham2018].

In order to simplify the thesis, my self-experimentation (2) are not explicitly documented, only mentioned in passing, though they inform the thesis throughout. The Case Studies that make up [Section II](#section-ii) focus solely on participatory co-design (1), while the embedded research activities (3) are documented in [Section IV](#section-iv) and inform the latter half of the thesis.

It was an important part of my research design, that these two types of activities happen in parallel throughout the duration of the the PhD, so that theory could inform practice and vice-versa. The Case Studies' work with participants serves to inform an evolving understanding of human needs around data, while the embedded work in external projects involves a conscious shift of mindset from PD to UCD, in essence using the Case Studies' findings as requirements and acting as a testing ground for emerging theories, models and themes coming out of the participatory work.

This cyclical back-and-forth between the theoretical/participatory work and the grounded/embedded projects did not need to follow a formal methodology or discipline, but philosophically takes inspiration from existing concepts that hang on the idea of developing learnings being fed back into an iterative process, allow plans and designs and understandings to be updated. In an academic context, a useful frame for this is _action research_ [@lewin1946] [^3] . In production industries, especially software development, a common model for this is _agile development_ [@fowler2001], where stakeholder feedback is collected at regular intervals. In entrepreneurial business contexts, terms like _fail fast_ [@brown2015] and _pivot_ [@ries2011] illustrate the idea that it is crucial to test ideas on real people then adapt quickly based on how that goes.

[^3]: It is important to note that while I, like many HCI researchers [@hayes2011], draw inspiration from an action research approach, I chose not to follow a formally-defined action research process such as _Participatory Action Research (PAR)_. PAR seeks to make sense of the world through collaborative efforts to transform the world rather than just observing and studying it [@lewin1951; @chevalier2008], as I do, however that is where the similarity ends; I determined that it would be more valuable to explore a variety of different contexts and activities over the PhD's course than to repeatedly loop back to the same participants for iterative feedback of a single set of designs.

Whichever term is most relatable to the reader, the common thread is the same: that research or investigation should be done in cycles: you learn something, carry out some action in the world based on your learning, learn from what happened, and repeat. This has become an established approach in HCI research [@hayes2011]. This PhD deliberately adopts a broad interpretation of these ideas. For me, getting value from action research does not mean that you must test every single idea with an audience for it to be considered valid, but rather that is important to consider that user engagement is not a one-off, but a repeated component that will continue to affect the research and learning path. Each new research activity will draw from past learnings and theories and acquired understandings so far, which are then developed through their exposure to real life in the process of participatory and embedded research activities.

![Figure 3.1: The Action Research Cycle, as Applied in this PhD](./src/figs/fig3.1-my-action-research-cycle.jpg){#figure-3.1}

[Figure 3.1](#figure-3.1) shows in the abstract, what each cycle of learning within this PhD looks like. In each area of life or context I identify as a setting for a research activity, I first carry out initial background reading, experimentation or exploration to familiarise myself with the area, then design a research activity that helps to explore the research questions in that area. After carrying out the planned activity I analyse any data from that activity (or just reflect upon my experience) and then use these findings to update my overall understanding of how we might answer the research questions. I then go on to repeat this cycle, with each subsequent activity, but beginning anew with more developed theories or understandings.

This cycle applies to both participatory activities (the design of which is fully in my control) and, to the greatest degree available to me, to the embedded project activities (whose design or implementation I was at times able to influence). [Figure 3.2](#figure-3.2) shows how the approach I have described here can be considered as two parallel tracks of participatory (theoretical) and embedded (practical) work, where downward arrows represent increasing learning and understanding. The positioning of activities as boxes along these arrows throughout the period of this PhD, indicates that that activity contributes to that area of understanding. Each track's learning is contributed to by multiple activities, which continue to inform each other, both within and across the two tracks. This ongoing cycle of learning and influence between the two tracks is indicated by the angled purple arrows. This diagram represents what was at the outset, a planned approach, but has been updated retrospectively with the actual timeline of activities undertaken, giving a more concrete view of how the research activities progressed in practice. Specific activities are detailed further in Sections [II](#section-ii) and [IV](#section-iv).

![Figure 3.2: The Two-Track Research Approach of this PhD, and its Feedback Cycles](./src/figs/fig3.2-two-track-research-approach.jpg){#figure-3.2}

These cycles enable analysis and learning to happen throughout, resulting in a continually updating current understanding that can form a baseline for subsequent research and practice activities. In the next section, I will describe the two specific research objectives that are targeted through the Case Studies, and the further goals of the embedded practical work.

Research Objectives{#3.3}
-------------------

The end of chapter 2 introduced the primary research question, which is:

**"What relationship do people want with their personal data?"**

As identified in [2.1.5](#2.1.5) and [2.2.5](#2.2.5), there are two distinct research gaps to be explored. The Case Studies, as well as preliminary explorations that feed into them, focus on exploring these two gaps, which are now expressed as two distinct research questions RQ1 [[3.3.1](#RQ1)] and RQ2 [[3.3.2](#RQ2)]:

### Research Question 1 (RQ1){#RQ1}

**What is the human experience of personal data, and what do people want from their data?**

Personal data, and its collection and use by commercial and civic organisations, is an established and inevitable part of modern life [[2.1](#2.1)], yet the concept of data is abstract and poorly understood. The first objective therefore is to establish a solid understanding of what mental models people have constructed about data. What makes data meaningful to people? Given HDI's belief that everyone needs a relationship with their data, what relationship do people currently have with their data? What _is_ data to people? How does that relationship affect them, and what are their unmet desires for improving their relationship to their personal data? What aspects of data cause positive emotions? What problems do people experience with their data? What people want from their data?

A participatory approach will be used to explore these questions: gathering individual perspectives on data, and looking for patterns or trends in those perspectives. The first challenge here will be to find ways to sensitise participants to be able to conduct an informed and productive conversation about the topic of data, which to the layperson may seem a dry, boring topic. This challenge will be addressed by leading participants into the subject of data using meaningful representations of data as stimulus for conversation, or starting with the individual's own life experience to discover the data in their life, which they are more likely to have opinions and emotions about, rather than talking about the subject in the abstract.

### Research Question 2 (RQ2){#RQ2}

**What role does data play in people's service relationships, and how could relationships involving data be improved?**

Sections [2.2](#2.2) and [2.3](#2.3) established that, as of yet, designers of PIM and personal data interfaces have not yet risen to the sociotechnical challenge of today's personal data reality: it is scattered, inaccessible and largely _un-useable_<sup>[11](#fn11)</sup>. There is no way for people to view their data holistically, as lamented by Ms. Heap in the quote atop [Chapter 1](#chapter-1). Nor are there tools to help people manage the many relationships that individuals have with companies, employers, councils, governments and other organisations that rely heavily upon the collection and processing of their personal data. Almost every civic or commercial service we use today handles data about us. We know that the world is data-centric, and that data controllers use data as an asset to inform their decision making, creating a serious imbalance of power [@wef2010; @wef2011; @wef2013; @wef2014lens; @wef2014context]. But what is like to conduct a relationship with an organisation that holds your data? What emotions do people experience? How does it affect their daily life, and what sort of problems do people face as a result of this data-centricity and digital life complexity? If your data is used in ways you do not understand or consent to, how does this affect your outlook on the world?

This is the second strand of research to be explored: to gain an understanding of the data world beyond the individual [[2.2.5](#2.2.5)], so that we can design not just better individual relationships to one's data, but improve people's relationships with organisations that hold and use data. For the purposes of this study, the focus will only be upon service relationships (the primary place where data is held), not social or interpersonal relationships.

To tackle RQ2, participatory research approaches are again appropriate, as the questions relate to the individual mental constructs that people have about their wider digital lives and relationships. But there is another aspect here, and that is that a relationship involves two parties. Consistent with Dewey's belief in the importance of interaction in creating meaning, the structuralist philosopher Michel Foucault said that 'meaning comes from discourse' [@adams2017]. In other words, people do not construct their reality in isolation, but rather it is shaped by the social constructs and systems they operate within. Deweyan pragmatism also takes the view that research must seek solutions to real world problems that are generalisable to use in society at large [@dewey1974; @friedman2006]. This implies that any such solutions arising from my research must work for all parties. For both these reasons, the participatory research seeks to understand both perspectives: that of the data controller and that of the data subject, and where possible both parties together will be engaged in discourse so that the two parties' worldviews can be brought together to design solutions that could work in practice for all involved.

This second research objective will be tackled in tandem with the first, so that in each research setting we can examine the situation at two levels–to look introspectively at the individual's own relationship in service of RQ1, but also to take a step back and look at the wider social context the individual is operating within, so that we might be better placed to answer RQ2.

### Practical Embedded Research: Going beyond the original RQs{#3.3.3}

<span class="editnote">review this following C7 intro framing</span>

While the Case Studies have the potential to uncover theoretical answers to RQ1 and RQ2, the parallel embedded project activities of this PhD presented the author with an opportunity to build a thesis offering more than just a theoretical expression of people's needs. By applying the learnings of the thesis in embedded project contexts, the primary research question of what relationship people want with their data can be explored in a real-world, practical sense. The embedded project work presents the opportunity to explore how individuals and groups might be able to take action to help change the world into the one they want, how these desired improved data relationships might be realised. In [Section III](#section-iii), an [extended RQ](#exRQ) is expressed, which is the focus of the embedded research track of the PhD. The practical exploration of this research question is documented in [Section IV](#section-iv). Methodologies for the embedded projects were not under the control of this researcher and therefore are not documented in this thesis, except where they form part of or contribute to the insights and learning acquired.

Methodologies Employed in Case Studies{#3.4}
--------------------------------------

This section will describe the methods used across the Case Studies within the participatory track, along with rationales as to why they were chosen. Loosely, the methods used can be grouped into five stages, though not every activity involved all stages:

1. Sensitisation of Researcher and Participants
2. Discussion and Exploration with Stimuli
3. Participatory Co-Design of Possible Solutions
4. Practical Data Experiments, Interface Design and Prototyping
5. Data Analysis and Thematic Synthesis

These five planned stages will be explained using examples and illustrations taken from the actual execution of these methods within the Case Studies. Information about recruitment and ethics follows at the end of this section.

### Sensitisation of Researcher and Participants{#3.4.1}

![Figure 3.3: Family Facts - What is Data? ](./src/figs/fig3.3-family-facts.jpg){#figure-3.3}

![Figure 3.4: Walls of Data - Sensitising Participants to the World of Commercially-held Data and GDPR](./src/figs/fig3.4-walls-of-data.jpg){#figure-3.4}

![Figure 3.5: Sentence Ranking - Bringing Support Workers and Families to a Shared Problem Space](./src/figs/fig3.5-sentence-ranking.jpg){#figure-3.5}

As described in [3.2.1](#3.2.1), an important first step before each research activity is to _sensitise_ oneself as researcher to the context, which means to become familiar with relevant issues, systems and practices and increase empathy for the participants. In the pilot study [[4.2.2](#4.2.2)], this entailed a grey literature review to identify the different types of civic data that councils store, and conversations with colleagues and partner organisations within the SILVER project to deepen my understanding of Early Help. The pilot study [[1.3.1](#1.3.1)] combined with this to serve as researcher sensitisation for Case Study One, as participating families had had some contact with the care system. This increased empathy for, and understanding of, supported family perspectives. Working with support workers through the SILVER project also provided empathy for the data needs of staff within the care service. In Case Study Two, self-experiments with GDPR as well as researching privacy policies and GDPR rights provided similar sensitisation before engaging participants.

Participants need to be sensitised too; when planning participatory research activities such as interviews or workshops, it is important to begin the session with an activity that will acclimatise participants both to the specific area of discussion, but also to the problem-solving mindset required for constructive conversation. This goes beyond ice-breaking, and into thinking about what the participants bring and lack at the start of the engagement. For example, in the pilot study, it was considered that data could be a hard topic for families to engage with, so the _Family Facts_ activity [[Figure 3.3](#figure-3.3)] was designed. This required family members to consider simple facts about their lives (some provided, some created by them) and discuss whether or not such a fact would be considered data, and additionally whether such a fact should be in the family's control or that of the authorities. This served a double purpose of teaching families that data is simply 'stored information about you', while also getting them used to thinking critically about data ownership. The technique is discussed further in [@bowyer2018family].

For Case Study Two, there was a goal to get participants to think about the data involved in their everyday lives, especially that stored by commercial service providers. So, using a series of posters in the researcher's lab common room were put up. These showed logos of companies that might store data, types of data that might be stored, information about GDPR rights, and possible uses that an individual might have for data they obtain from a GDPR request. Some of these posters are shown in [Figure 3.4](#figure-3.4). These posters served both as a recruitment tool for the project and a discussion prompt for participant onboarding.

Sensitisation activities can also serve an additional purpose of bringing disparate participants to be 'on the same page'. This is known in participatory research as _co-experience_ [@battarbee2005]. An example of this is the _sentence ranking_ exercise used at the start of all workshops in Case Study Two [[Figure 3.5](#figure-3.5)]. Here, a series of sentences were prepared containing opinions about civic data that had been observed from staff and families in earlier research. Participants were asked to rank these according to _agreement_ and _importance_. This allowed validation of whether previous findings still held with these participants, but also acclimatised the participants to considering and discussing the civic data context and the problems experienced by families and staff. Since the sentences included both staff and family viewpoints, and the activity was carried out in all workshops regardless of whether staff, families or both were present, it served to establish a common set of 'requirements' that would be in participants' minds as they began the subsequent co-design activity within each workshop.

### Discussion and Exploration with Stimuli{#3.4.2}

![Figure 3.6: Family Civic Data Cards - Things to Think With](./src/figs/fig3.6-data-cards.jpg){#figure-3.6}

![Figure 3.7: Personal Data Examples - Making Data Relatable](./src/figs/fig3.7-personal-data-examples.png){#figure-3.7}

![Figure 3.8: Home Interviewing: Card Sorting with a Family in Their Living Room](./src/figs/fig3.8-home-visit.jpg){#figure-3.8}

As discussed in [3.2.1](#3.2.1), this research seeks to uncover individual perspectives and worldviews. The primary method used in both Case Studies was traditional qualitative interviewing - talking to people about the topic being explored. In Case Study Two, this was largely done on 1-on-1 basis (largely because of the sensitivity of dealing with one's own personal data, and because it allowed the researcher to get closer to the participant's individual experience). In Case Study One, group discussions and activities were mainly used, which brought the advantage of being able to _prime_ a discussion between participants and then sit back into more of an observational role. This proved particularly insightful when observing intergenerational conversations between family members in the pilot study [[4.2.2](#4.2.2)]. In Case Study One, it allowed the negotiation of a 'middle ground' between support workers and supported families to be observed. In some cases, such as the home visits in the pilot study and local authority visits for SILVER, the researcher was able to conduct interviews-in-place [@pink2013] in participants' own environments, which allowed for additional ethnographic observations to be made as 'life happens around' [@mannay2015] the participants, as discussed in [@bowyer2018family].

Motivated by a desire to go beyond 'just talking' to achieve a deeper and more detail-oriented conversation, the decision was made to produce suitable stimuli to seed and progress each discussion. Given the abstract nature of the topic of data, it does not always carry a clear meaning in people's everyday lives, so the stimuli needed to  make the topic vivid and real. Building on the aforementioned researcher sensitisation, a taxonomy and lexicon for Family Civic Data was created, and _Family Civic Data Cards_ [[Figure 3.6](#figure-3.6)] were constructed for use in activities and discussions. These serve as _boundary objects_ [@star1989; @star2010; @bowker2016] - representational artefacts that are understandable by people who come from different perspectives, providing a common vocabulary for discussion (as well as serving to enable co-experience, detailed above). Each card represents a different category of data, including a _summary_ and _meaningful examples_ to make them be easy to digest, yet still containing sufficient detail to stimulate thinking. The cards were designed to be bright, child-friendly and appealing to engage with. The tangibility of these artefacts was important. An approach of using tangible artefacts is valuable for situating legal and ethical discussions in context, by providing some concrete _things to think with_ [@papert1980; @brandt2004], facilitating reflection and discussion. Similar card-based approaches have been used by other researchers with success, such as Mora's Tiles IoT cards [@mora2017], Lane's Unbias Awareness Cards [@lane2018] and Urquhart's Moral IT Deck [@urquhart2021].

More generally, researchers have had success with the use of tangible objects to embody discussion concepts in order to stimulate and structure discussion, for example Coughlan's use of a dolls' house to explore attitudes to home energy use [@coughlan2013a] or more recently Xie's Data City which used AR-enhanced cardboard models to represent data-processing functions [@xie2021]. These approaches have their roots in Dourish's concept of _embodied interaction_ [@dourish2001]. The cards were used throughout the Civic Data research in both sensitisation and _card sorting_ [@spencer2004] tasks, for example asking participants to position the cards on a pinboard according to perceptions about risk and ownership [[Figure 3.8](#figure-3.8)], or sorting them into trays according to relative personal importance. The cards proved very effective at enabling a personal and detail-oriented discussion. Participants voluntarily opened up about sensitive topics (e.g. domestic violence or criminal records) raised by the cards because of their detached-but-relatable nature [@bowyer2018family].

In Case Study Two, discussions around data did not use data cards, but the importance of meaningful examples to make the topic relatable persisted, in this case being demonstrated through posters [[3.4.1](#3.4.1)] and in particular a categorisation of example data by category [[Figure 3.7](#figure-3.7)], similar to the examples on Case Study One's data cards. Within the BBC R&D placement, data cards pertaining to held personal data types and actions were subsequently developed for use in participatory research [[Figure 9.16](#figure-9.16); [Figure 9.17](#figure-9.17)].

The sketching dialogue technique [@hwang2021; [Figure 5.2](#figure-5.2)] used in the digital life context can also been as another stimulus technique; by putting both participant and researcher's focus upon the page, rather than on each other, it can feel less invasive, more collaborative and makes it easier to focus on details. The ideal stimulus for discussion about data is to view the actual data itself. Due to the sensitivity of personal data, this is more easily done 1-on-1 than in a group. Exploring data together with participants to elicit opinions and insights is a well-established technique [@coughlan2013b; @chung2016; @puussaar2017]. This is the technique used within Case Study Two, asking participants about the data they retrieved from GDPR requests, using a spreadsheet-based approach [3.4.2.OLD](#5.2.2). This allowed the Zoom-based interviews to retain a 'gathered around the table looking at things together' ambiance despite the remoteness necessitated by COVID-19 restrictions.

### Participatory Co-Design of Possible Solutions{#3.4.3}

![Figure 3.10: Group Poster Design - A Participant-designed Poster to Advertise Features of Imagined Data Interface Products](./src/figs/fig3.10-poster.jpg){#figure-3.10}

![Figure 3.11: Storyboarding Action Cards - A Collaboratively-constructed Narrative Created through Discussion from a Palette of Possible Parent and Staff Actions](./src/figs/fig3.11-storyboarding-card-strip.jpg){#figure-3.11}

Participatory Design (PD) [[3.2.1](#3.2.1)] becomes particularly important when exploring solutions and ideals to identified problems. It involves bringing participants into a _new mental space_ where they can imagine the realm of the _possible_, rather than just their current lived experience. PD was an important part of Case Study One research with  all participants. In the early stages of a PD activity, it is important that participants are able to generate a wide range of ideas, even fantastical ones, without constraints, self-censoring or judgements. This is known as the _discovery_ phase in the UK Design Council's _double diamond_ framework. [@designcounciluk2004]. Golembewski's _ideation decks_ technique [@golembewski2010] was chosen for this purpose [[Figure 3.9](#figure-8)], as it allows participants to both select 'ingredients' of a design based on their own experience but also to combine them in a variety of different ways to generate novel ideas, guiding them into a previously unconsidered solution space.

After generating a wide range of ideas using the ideation decks, participants were then invited to pick just one or two ideas to develop into posters, each with three 'features' highlighted. An example is shown in [[Figure 3.10](#figure-3.10)]. This activity corresponds to the _define_ phase of the double diamond, where participants narrow down options.

For the final workshop of Case Study One, where both parents and staff were brought together to explore possibilities of shared data interaction within the support relationship, a _storyboarding_ activity was designed. Drawing from the world of film production, storyboarding is a well-established technique in participatory design [@spinuzzi2005; @moraveji2007]. Usually it involves the participants drawing out a series of sketches in the form of a comic strip 'telling the story' of an interaction, encounter or activity. However, given the need [[1.1.2](#1.1.2); [3.2.1](#3.2.1)] to focus on interpersonal relations and process rather than the visual aspects of storytelling or interface design, and drawing upon earlier successes with data cards, a card-based approach to storyboarding was used. Participants selected actions from a palette of action cards representing different possible human or data interaction possibilities and annotated these with specific details. These cards are shown in [Figure 3.11](#figure-3.11) and described in more detail in [ARI4.3](#ari-storyboarding).

### Data Analysis{#3.4.4}

![Figure 3.12: Thematic Analysis of Qualitative Data using Quirkos for Case Study One](./src/figs/fig3.12-thematic-analysis.png){#figure-3.12}

![Figure 3.13: Spreadsheet-based Quantitative Analysis of Interview Data for Case Study Two](./src/figs/fig3.13-quant-analysis.png){#figure-3.13}

In order to find common viewpoints and extract insights from the many participatory activities conducted in Case Study One and Two, the qualitative data needed analysis. The general approach taken was to audio record (and, in some cases, video record) all interviews and workshops, and to produce a written transcript of the words spoken. Digital photos were taken to capture card arrangements, rankings and other transitory choices, as well as designs, life sketches and other participant creations. While it is possible to analyse participant designs in more detail, here their sole purpose was to provide additional context for understanding conversation transcripts. Field notes were captured during or soon after each engagement. Then a process of thematic analysis was undertaken. This involved examining the text of the transcripts (with reference to all relevant digital artefacts to add context), and identifying the underlying ideas, themes and opinions of the participants. Thematic coding is a well-established technique in qualitative research [@braun2006]. _Quirkos_ software was selected for this purpose, as shown in [Figure 3.12](#figure-3.12), due to it having a more visual organisation and simpler approach than the more commonly used _nVivo_. After initial coding of transcripts, a process of reductive data display cycles [@huberman2002] was used to group codes into themes which became the key findings of Chapters [4](#chapter-4) and [5](#chapter-5).

While the participant data in Case Study One and Two was largely free-flowing and very loosely-structured conversation, the structure of some activities allowed some data to be captured numerically, notably the sentence rankings and data card placements in Case Study One and the trust/power ratings and GDPR spreadsheets produced in Case Study Two. These datapoints were captured into Excel spreadsheets, and where appropriate analysed using formulae to produce weighted mean averages and standard deviations to help contextualise the findings. An example is shown (as evidence rather than explanation) in [Figure 3.13](#figure-3.13). Due to the qualitative focus of the research, participant numbers were too low to seek statistically significant findings, so all quantitative findings are not intended to be representative of any population at large.

Table: Table 3.1 - Context One (Civic Data & Early Help): Participants involved in Research Activities leading into Case Study One.

Tables [3.1](#table-3.1) and [3.2](#table-3.2) summarise the participants involved in this research. In Case Study One, recruitment was initially attempted using posters placed in local libraries as shown in [Figure 3.14](#figure-3.14) below. When this approach was unsuccessful, participants were successfully recruited with the assistance of a local community centre, which allowed me to visit a community social meeting and talk to residents about my study. This community was located in a low-income area that was known to include a number of supported families; this was chosen with a view to reaching a similar population as SILVER.

For the main engagement of Case Study One, the researcher worked with two local authorities, Newcastle City Council and North Tyneside Council, who were partners on the SILVER project. These authorities provided suitable participants who were actively involved in their Early Help programmes. In the pilot study and in the first families workshop of the main study (stage 1A), activities were designed to include children as active participants in the research. It was felt they would bring valuable contributions to the somewhat abstract creative co-design work and this also allowed observation of intra-family conversations. The final combined workshop with staff (stage 2) was designed to only include adult participants. This is because the focus on processes and on the care relationship itself was thought to be too boring and potentially sensitive for the children to participate.

Table: Table 3.2 - Context Two (Digital Life): Participants Involved in Digital Life Research Activities Leading into Case Study Two.

[^4]:
One participant withdrew from the study after the first interview of the Guided GDPR study due to COVID-19. The other 10 participants took part in all three stages.

In Case Study Two, no special population was needed, as the issues of living in a data-centric world affect everyone. Therefore, a convenience sample (largely 20-to-40-year-old postgraduate students from Newcastle University) was used. Care was taken to find an even split of male and female participants, but other than that no selection criteria were applied. Given their proximity to the Digital Civics programme, the participants for this study were thought likely to have a larger awareness of societal issues around personal data use and greater familiarity with participatory co-design than the layperson. This was considered an advantage as they would require less sensitisation.

In all cases[^5] for both case studies, participants were compensated for their time with vouchers—either online/offline shopping vouchers or vouchers for a family day out.

(with one exception - the staff workshops within Case Study Two. Because the participants were attending the workshops through their employers (the local authorities), we were not allowed to provide vouchers for participation.)

### Ethics{#3.4.6}

All research activities referenced in this thesis were planned in advance, with interview schedules, information sheets, debriefing sheets, participant consent forms and ethics forms being completed and submitted to Newcastle University's SAgE faculty ethics board, which approved all the studies before they commenced. Ethics approvals are included in [Appendix B](#appendix-b). Most of the engagements were routine interviews and therefore did not require any special measures for safety or ethical reasons. It was made clear to all participants that they were free to withdraw from my research at any time without giving a reason. The following special measures were included in plans in order to satisfy ethical considerations:

1. _Visiting private homes_: In order to protect myself and other researchers from any physical risks or any accusations of impropriety, all home visits took place with two researchers present, and contact was made with a colleague before and immediately after the interviews to confirm everything was ok.

2. _Working with children_: Activities were designed to be child-friendly (not just safe, but engaging). The families workshop took place at in a function room within a park with a nearby cafe and playgrounds for children, and catering was provided. Within the room, an activity area was provided for smaller children who were not directly participating to play while their parents and older siblings engaged. There was always more than one researcher present and the research team was never alone with children.

3. _Protecting personal data privacy_: In Case Study Two, particular care was taken to design ways for researchers to talk to people about their personal data without violating participants' right to privacy. The research was positioned that the data retrieved from companies was participants' own data, that would never be directly collected or handled by the research team. It was made clear that the researchers were only interested in what was said, not personal data itself. Initially, a privacy monitor was developed which could only be seen with viewing glasses that were in the participant's control [See [ARI3.1](#ari-monitor)]. This would allow a researcher to sit next to a participant who was viewing his/her personal data, without the researcher being able to see it. Additional measures to protect users' data included clear instructions on how to keep data safe before, during and after the study. A complaints procedure was also written at the request of the Ethics board.

4. _Adapting to COVID-19_: As COVID-19 changed working and living conditions in early 2020, Case Study Two was adapted to no longer rely on face-to-face engagement. The in-person privacy monitor approach mentioned above was abandoned and replaced with an online Zoom-based approach. In this model, participants would share parts of their data using screen sharing instead, and could move windows off screen to protect their privacy. The full study plan for Case Study Two was rewritten for online-based participation and was re-approved by the Ethics Board.

Summation: Towards an Understanding of Better Data Relations{#3.5}
------------------------------------------------------------

As Section I concludes, we have now established the background and motivation to this PhD research, and explained the approach to be used - a two track research endeavour examining both participant attitudes and pragmatic sociotechnical realities. [Section II](#section-ii) will describe the participatory research track that seeks to answer RQ1 [[3.3.1](#RQ1)] and RQ2 [[3.3.2](#RQ2)]. [Section III](#section-iii) will then synthesise the findings across the two studies to formulate a research agenda for better data relations, the operationalisation of which will be documented, along with the embedded project work track, in [Section IV](#section-iv).
