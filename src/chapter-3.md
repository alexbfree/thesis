Methodology {#chapter-3}
=======================

In the previous chapter, I described three research areas this thesis seeks to explore: how people think about data and what they want from it, how data fits into people's relationships with organisations and how they want it to be used, and how could people's desires for the role data plays in their lives be brought closer to reality. In this chapter I will explain my approach to conducting research in this area, detail the types of methods used, and explain how the different research activities I carried out contribute to those three research aims.

# Forming a Research Paradigm: Ontology & Epistemology

To develop a research paradigm it is important to begin with reflecting upon your outlook on the nature of reality (ontology) and your beliefs on how knowledge of that reality is formed (epistemology) [REF Guba (1990)]. It will already be evident from the literature review and the framing of this thesis so far that individual human perspectives are at the centre of my research questions. This is a reflection of my ontological stance which is that everyone experiences their own reality, informed by their own concepts and mental models of the world. This is known as _constructivism_ [REF], as distinct from the positivist view that there is a single universal reality that needs to be uncovered. However, people's realities are constantly shifting and changing, especially when it comes to the rapidly changing technological landscape we live in today reality -- consider that today our reality includes concepts that did not exist in our youth, from "feeds" and "posts" to "link sharing", "syncing" and "blocking". As new technologies and practices emerge, we develop new mental models to help us make sense of, and find value in, new capabilities. This idea of reality as something constantly renegotiated by the individual is known as _pragmatism_ [REF]. To me this is an overriding truth about reality and this focus on understanding change, as perceived by individuals, is a key motivation. Where constructists may focus more upon deeply understanding an individual's reality at a moment in time, I am more interested in understanding the ways in which people's understanding of the world, and of themselves, changes as a result of their lived experience. At this point we must consider the individual's motivation for constructing and pragmatically changing their concepts of the world, and to understand this we can look to _objectivism_ [REF], which is a belief that the mind, informed by the senses, is a means of discovering truths about the world, and it does so by forming concepts and using _inductive reasoning_ [REF] (in essence, "if these things are true then what else must be true?") to acquire knowledge - in essence, people's conceptions of reality are constantly tested and re-evaluated by their experiences of the world. Objectivism also states that individual's motivation in life is the pursuit of one's own happiness and wellbeing, and that this self-interest is what drives his pursuit of deeper knowledge and understanding about the world; in essence, everyone wants to improve their own life, and they need knowledge to do it, and for me this view of understanding the nature of reality, so that one might be able to change it for the better is also a key driver behind my research. As a final element to incorporate, I also look to _Deweyan pragmatism_, which states that our knowledge and thinking are tested by actions, not just reason, and that this is how we learn - and that communication and interaction with others is a key part of that learning. Dewey recognises that every individual is not solitary, he exists within a society; he "is a social being, a citizen, growing and thinking in a vast complex of interactions and relationships." [@dewey1974] People create systems and meanings through those interactions which they can then use to understand everyday life; this is particularly important in the social world, as unlike the physical, natural world .

My established ontological stance, then, is that individuals construct concepts, and continually update them through sensory experience, action, social interaction and inductive reasoning in order to maintain a pragmatic knowledge that they can practically apply in society and in the world in order to pursue their own happiness and self-interest.

Based upon this, we can now look to epistemology - how do
