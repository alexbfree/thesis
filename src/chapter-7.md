Discussion II: Designing and Pursuing Better Human Data Relations {#chapter-7}
=======================

> _"Civilizations advance not by the technology they know about, but by the technology they don't have to know about."_ -- Anonymous proverb

Introduction & Background
----------------

Through the Case Studies (Chapter 4 & 5) and the discussion in Chapter 6, a clear understanding of what people want from direct and indirect data relations (RQ1 & RQ2) has been established. In this chapter, we turn our attention from theory to practice, from what is needed to *what is possible*. Specifically, this chapter will return to the overall research question and consider _"How might [better Human Data Relations] be achieved?"_, and answer this question by describing practical approaches for future research, innovation and policy that are either novel or already emergent.

This chapter is deliberately broad and open ended. It does not pretend to be complete or definitive in its interpretation of the outlook for HDR. It is not a roadmap, but rather a snapshot of ongoing work, identified challenges and known opportunities, forming an **anthology of reference material**, based on my research and design experience from my six years working to understand and advance HDR.

The rationale here is that it will be valuable for anyone working in the HDR space to have a good high-level understanding of the landscape as well as specific ideas to work with; the goal is to boost and strengthen any such activities so that they might benefit from the insights gained.

The shape this chapter takes is to consider the the six HDR wants that this thesis has uncovered [[Chapter 6](#chapter-6)] as a basis for defining **objectives** for the HDR landscape, then to to illustrate what specific **obstacles** and **opportunities** are relevant when attempting to pursue those objectives, as well as to highlight specific **designerly insights** that are relevant.

There are many aspects to the wide-reaching objective of better HDR in practice: technical, design, commercial, legal, moral, social and political and this chapter does not cover them all, nor is it formal empirical research.
Instead, detail is provided in the form of **real world practical designs and insights** from four industrial and academic research projects I was part of during the same timeframe as the empirical research, as well as from the work of other innovators and activists. This detail is contextualised relative to existing literature and the thesis' earlier contributions.

Some of the challenges and opportunities herein are described in greater detail than others, corresponding only to my proximity and depth of engagement with those ideas rather than their relative merit, complexity or impact potential. I consider that it is more useful to introduce a range of applicable ideas even if some are only lightly detailed, rather than to detail just a few.

In section 7.1.1 the peripheral R & D activities I undertook are described; forming the primary point of reference for this chapter, as this peripheral work has informed and allowed me to build upon the core HDR understanding from the empirial research, and much of the work has often aligned well to the six data wants [[Chapter 6](#chapter-6)]. Often the work has exposed evolving areas where different actors are trying to bring about better HDR.

In section 7.1.2, I explain some important context about the nature of the ideas presented in this chapter and how to attribute them fairly.

In section 7.1.3, I introduce some additional background on _Theories of Change (ToC)_, which are used as a framing device for structuring the opportunities described in the main body of this chapter into a series of different possible trajectories for change.

In section 7.1.4, I consider the researcher-turned-activist stance that drives this chapter, framing the pursuit of better HDR as a _recursive public_.

In section 7.2, I formalise and expand the Human Data Relations concept. Additional insights into how people relate to data are identified, as well an important dichotomy of two distinct drivers that motivate people's needs for better relations with their data.

Section 7.3 and 7.4 form the main body of this chapter, with obstacles and insights being detailed in section 7.3 and specific opportunities into how better Human Data Relations can be pursued in practice being described in 7.4. 7.4 identifies four specific trajectories of change (interpreted using the ToC frame described in 7.1.3). Within each of these four trajectories, specific named opportunities are described.

Section 7.5 concludes the thesis, summarising the change trajectories presented in 7.4, reflecting on my journey as a researcher and summarising the thesis' contributions as a whole.

### Peripheral Research & Design Settings

[TODO Move 3.4.3 etc. to here and remove all refs to 3.4.3]

The majority of examples and learnings shared in this chapter come from my participation as an expert researcher and designer in two industrial research projects:

1. **BBC R&D's Cornmarket Project**, which explored through user experience design, technical prototyping and participatory research, how individuals might interact with data through a Personal Data Store interface (see 3.4.3.3)
2. **Sitra/Hestia.ai's #digipower Project**, a successor to Case Study Two, in which European politicians examined companies' data practices through exercising data rights and conducting technical audits (see 3.4.3.4)

In addition, my participation as an interface designer and front-end software developer in the following two academic research projects contributes secondarily to this chapter:

3. **Connected Health Cities (CHC)'s SILVER Project**, where I, along with a backend developer and a team of researchers, developed a prototype health data viewing interface for Early Help support workers (see 3.4.3.1).
4. **Digital Economy Research Centre (DERC)'s Healthy Eating Web Augmentation Project**, which explored the use of web augmentation techniques to modify the user interface of takeaway service Just Eat to insert health information, in support of healthy eating (see 3.4.3.2).

### Attribution of Insights

While this thesis is my own original work, and many ideas presented in this chapter are fully original, some of the specific details, theories and ideas presented in this chapter arose or were developed or augmented through my close collaboration, discussion and ideation with other researchers, including:

 - Jasmine Cox, Suzanne Clarke, Tim Broom, Rhianne Jones, Alex Ballantyne and others at BBC R&D;
 - Paul-Olivier Dehaye, Jessica Pidoux, Francois  at Hestia.ai;
 - Stuart Wheater of Arjuna Technologies and Kyle Montague of Open Lab during the SILVER project; and
 - Louis Goffe of Open Lab on the DERC Healthy Eating project
 - earlier innovation work with Alistair Croll at Rednod, Montréal, Canada (circa 2011) and with Megan Beynon at IBM Hursley, UK (circa 2006).

Due to these collaborations and the ongoing and parallel nature of many of these projects to my PhD research, it is impossible to precisely delineate the origin of each idea or insight. In practice, ideas from my developing thesis and own thinking informed the projects' trajectories and thinking, and vice-versa. These ideas would not have emerged in this form without my participation, so they are not the sole intellectual property of others, but equally I would not have reached the same conclusions alone, so the ideas are not solely my own either. All diagrams and illustrations were produced by me, except where specified, and the overall synthesis and framing presented in this chapter is my own original work. Where this chapter includes material from the four projects, that material is either already public, or permission has been obtained from the corresponding project teams.

### Theories of Change

To provide a structure for cataloguing the insights conveyed by this chapter, I use a _Theory of Change (ToC)_ framing. ToC is a set of methodologies is commonly used by philanthropists, educators and those trying to improve the lives of disadvantaged populations [@brest2010]; the theories can be used in different ways including planning, participatory design and field evaluation of the effectiveness of new initiatives. There are many different implementations, but common to most of them is a focus on explicitly mapping out desired outcomes [@taplin2012] with a clear focus on who is acting and whether the change being brought about is a change in action, or a change in thinking [@vanEs2015]. In this chapter, ToC theory will be used in a very limited way, not as a methodology but simply to provide a structural frame for proposed changes, as described below. Using ToC to perform evaluation of the effectiveness of proposed change approaches in action in society would be well beyond the scope of this thesis. Nonetheless, this frame is a useful way to map out the different approaches to changing the world in pursuit of the ideal of better HDR.

![Figure 29: The Four Dimensions of Change[^16]](./src/figs/fig29-dimensions-of-change.png)

[^16]: Diagram used here unchanged from _Hivos ToC Guidelines_ [@vanEs2015, p90] under a CC-BY-NC-SA 3.0 license, whose authors state that this diagram was adapted from earlier work by Wilber (1996), Keystone (2008) and Retolaza (2010, 2012).

Figure 29 illustrates the aspects of ToC thinking that section 7.4 will use as its frame. Specifically, desired changes can be broken down into:

- _**Internal changes**_: changes in thinking, feeling, reasoning, understanding, attitudes or identity.
- _**External changes**_: changes in actions, behaviour, interactions, structure, policy, technological capability, processes and the external environment.

At the same time, desired changes can be broken down into:

- _**Individual changes**_: changes to individual thought or actions
- _**Collective changes**_: changes to the thoughts or actions of groups of people together, or to the systems, practices and norms of society at large.

These two splits produce four dimensions of change, and form four quadrants representing different types of change, which are shown in Figure 29 and described here:

- _**Individual/Internal (II)**_: This top-left quadrant represents changes to what individuals know and understand, and to how they think, feel and plan to take action.
- _**Individual/External (IE)**_: This top-right quadrant represents changes to how individuals' relationships with others; acting (or being enabled to act) differently in their daily lives and when interacting within society.
- _**Collective/Internal (CI)**_: This bottom-left quadrant represents changes in the shared knowledge of groups of people or to the collective identity or values of social groups.
- _**Collective/External (CE)**_: This bottom-right quadrant represents changes to the structures and procedures within which people operate, including technology, law, societal norms and communications.

Key to ToC thinking is the idea that making changes in one quadrant can stimulate change in others; for example, collective learning about data attitudes and practices, such as the research conducted in this PhD, (lower left quadrant) could inform the design of new technologies, interfaces or processes (lower right quadrant), which if built could make new structures available to have an impact on improving individual-provider relationships (upper-right quadrant). The changes to those relationships could then in turn lead to individuals thinking and feeling differently (upper left quadrant), for example feeling more empowered or having greater awareness of data practices.

### Better Human Data Relations as a Recursive Public

Before engaging with the practicalities of pursuing change, it is valuable to revisit the stance from which we approach this change. As outlined in 3.2, the research of this PhD has been grounded in participatory action research and experience-centred design; by using a Digital Civics [@vlachokyriakos2016] frame to gain deep understanding of people's needs and the ways those needs are not fully met, we can see how the world needs to change. Section 3.2 already outlined that we can consider such research as political, seeking to correct an imbalance in the world. In this chapter, we look beyond identifying what change is needed, and step into the role of activist, exploring how individuals and groups can actually change the world they inhabit.

In doing so, we can consider ourselves (those who pursue better Human Data Relations, or _HDR reformers_ as a shorthand) as a _recursive public_ [@kelty2008;@p2pwikiRecursivePublic], albeit a nascent one. This is a term originating in the free software movement to describe a _"collective, independent of other forms of constituted power, capable of speaking to existing forms of power through the production of actually existing alternatives"_. This term captures the idea that through various means at our disposal: participatory research, experience-centred design, engineering software prototypes, exertion of legal rights, and efforts to raise public awareness, we seek to modify the systems and practices we live within in pursuit of our goals. This collective around better Human Data Relations does not yet exist as a named and identifiable _public_ [@ledantec2016] but its members congregate around emergent collectives in interconnected and overlapping spaces, most notably the MyData community [@mydata2017declaration] and its members, but also research and activism agendas including but not limited to: digital rights [@openRightsGroup], gig economy worker rights [@kirven2018], privacy by design [@cavoukian2010], data justice [@taylor2017;@crivellaro2019], critical algorithm studies [@gillespie2016], humane technology [@harris2013] and explainable AI [@explainableAI].

Whether these disparate groups coalesce into a single identifiable public remains to be seen, and so too whether the term this thesis offers of _Human Data Relations_ is sufficient to capture that public (at least, it provides a descriptive umbrella term). Nonetheless, the breadth of research and innovation and activism happening in this space validates both the need and the desire for such a recursive public around better HDR to exist. Therefore, this chapter takes an unashamedly critical view of the status quo, favouring disruptive societal changes that would further the objectives of better Human Data Relations and providing actionable approaches that will be of use to the members of this public. The chapter asks, "How can we change the world into the one we want?"

Refining and Defining 'Human Data Relations' (HDR){#7.2}
--------------------------------------------------

[TODO ADD A TWO SENTENCE DEFINITION, MORE CLEARLY FRAME THE NEW FIELD]
[ reference HDI style, Human "data" relations, human/data relations (like PR ref C5) ]

Chapter 6 established six 'wants' that people have in their relationships with data: **visible**, **understandable** and **usable data**; **process transparency**, **individual oversight** and **decision-making involvement**. At a simplistic level therefore 'better' HDR can be achieved by working to improve upon those six aspects of data interaction. However, as this section will explain, HDR can be conceptually split into two distinct motives, to which those six wants apply differently, therefore it is useful to develop the concept of HDR further. As background understanding for this duality of motivation, it is first necessary to examine more closely what role data plays in people's lives.

### The Role of Personal Data

In the modern world, where almost anything can be encoded as data, and given many previously analogue objects and activities now have digital equivalents, the concept of data has become broad and hard to pin down. Underlying Human Data Relations is to explain what roles data can play in people's lives -- what it **is** to people. Through the Case Studies, external work and my prior learning, I have so far identified 8 distinct lenses to consider how people might relate to it. These are modelled in Table 15.

Table: Table 15. **Eight lenses on data**.

| Way of thinking about data | Explanation & Implications |
|:--------|:---------------------------------------------------|
|Data as property|Data can be considered as a possession. This highlights issues of ownership, responsibility, liability and theft.|
|Data as a source of information about you|Knowing that data contains encoded assertions about you and can be used to derive further conjectures enables thinking about how it might be exploited by others, but also how you can explore and use it yourself for reflection, asking questions, self-improvement and planning. It invites consideration of the right to access, data protection, and issues around accuracy, fairness and misinterpretation / misuse.|
|Data as part of oneself|A photo or recording of you, or a typed note or search that popped into your head could be deeply personal. This lens on data highlights issues around emotional attachment/impact, privacy, and ethics.|
|Data as memory|Data can be considered as an augmentation to one's memory, a digital record of your life. This lens facilitates design thinking around search and recall, browsing, summarising, cognitive offloading, significance/relevance, and the personal value of data.|
|Data as creative work|Some of the data we produce (e.g. writing, videos, images) can be considered as an artistic creation. This lens enables thinking about attribution, derivation, copying, legacy and cultural value to others.|
|Data as new information about the world|Data created by others can inform us about previously unknown occurrences in our immediate digital life or the wider world. This lens is useful for thinking about discovery, recommendations, bias, censorship, filter bubbles, and who controls the information sources we use, as well as who will see and interpret data that we generate and what effects our data has on others.|
|Data as currency|Many data-centric services require data to be sacrificed in exchange for access to functionality, and some businesses now explicitly enable you to sell your own data. This lens highlights that data can be thought of as a tradable asset, and invites consideration of issues of data's worth, individual privacy, exploitation and loss of control.|
|Data as a medium for thinking, communicating and expression|Some people collect and organise data into curated collections, or use it to convey facts and ideas, to persuade or to evoke an emotional impact. This lens is useful to consider data uses such as lists, annotation, curation, editing, remixing, visualisation and producing different views of data for different audiences.|

When considering HDR, it is important to recognise that people may think of their personal data through any or all of these _'lenses'_ [@karger2005;2.2.2] at any given time, and any process or system design involving data interaction should take these into account.

Looking across this set of lenses, it is possible to identify four specific roles that data can serve:

1. Data has a role as an **artifact of value** to your life;
2. Data has a role in **informing** you about yourself, the world, and the prior or recent actions of others that may affect you;
3. Data has a role as **a usable material with which to effect change** in your life;
4. Data has a role as **a means to monitor changes** in data holders' behaviours, digital influences upon you or changes within your life.

### Human Data Interaction or Human Information Interaction?

To unpack HDR further, it is important to highlight the difference between humans relating to data, and humans relating to information. Human Data Interaction (HDI) concerns the way people interact with data. Mortier _et al._  [@mortier2013;@mortier2014] defined the field of HDI without distinguishing data (the digital artifact stored on computer) from information (the facts or assertions that said data can provide when interpreted). This is an important distinction. The parallel field of Human Information Interaction (HII) originated in library sciences, and considers the way humans relate to information without regard to the technologies involved [@marchionini2008]. William Jones _et al._ called for a new sub-field of HII in an HCI context[^17], observing that it is important to include a focus on information interaction because HCI can _"unduly focus attention on the computer when, for most people, the computer is a means to an end – the effective use of information"_ [@jones2006]. DIKW theory [[2.1](#2.1)] highlights that **interpretation of data to obtain information** is a discrete activity. This was borne out in the findings of Case Study Two, where it became clear that participants have distinct needs from data, and from information (5.4.3.2). Access to data **and** information is critical to both understanding and useability, as detailed in section 6.1.2 and 6.1.3.

[^17]: The group of HCI researchers involved in this panel were (with the exception of Raya Fidel) seemingly unaware of the existing HII field in library sciences as they positioned the publication as a call for a 'new field'.

Drawing on this theory, we can see then that in considering Human Data Relations, there are in fact three distinct artifacts to consider:

1. _**data**_ - the stored digital artifacts pertaining to users held by organisations for algorithmic processing and human reference, copies of which can be obtained using individual data rights.
2. _**information about individuals**_ - the collection of facts and assertions about the individual and their life, which are obtained through human or algorithmic interpretation of stored data (or in some organisations' case, through analytical inference).
3. _**information about data**_ (also categorised in Table 9 / 5.3.1 as _**metadata**_) - stored facts about the data, such as where it has been stored, who has accessed it, how it was collected, what it means, or when it has been shared externally.

### The Two Distinct Motivations for Human Data Relations

By making this distinction between the two types of information which people might interact with, and considering the six wants in Chapter 6, it becomes clear that there are two very different reasons why people might want better HDR:

(i) to acquire _information about one's **data**_, so that one might exert control over and make informed choices about where _the data_ is held and how it is used, in order to be treated fairly and gain more control over the use of one's personal data. This is **Personal Data Ecosystem Control (PDEC)**.

(ii) to acquire _information about oneself_, so that one might gain insights into one's own behaviour and gain personal benefits from those insights or them to make changes in one's life. This is **Life Information Utilisation (LIU)**.

The two distinct processes that individuals might go through in pursuit of these motives are exemplified in Figure 30. PDEC is a process of holding organisations to account over and managing _what happens to personal data_, often regardless of what it means, whereas LIU is more concerned with _what the data means_ and its inherent value as encoded life information, regardless of where it is stored and how it is used[^18]. This novel way of modelling the motivations for data interaction were first proposed in my 2021 workshop paper [@bowyer2021].

![Figure 30: The Two Motivations for HDR: Controlling your personal data ecosystem and utilising your information about your life, with 'idealised'[^19] processes illustrated](./src/figs/fig30-the-two-motivations-for-hdr.jpg)

[^18]: Of course, there is some overlap; the reason that organisations hold data is so that they can interpret it (usually algorithmically) to inform decision-making. In this way, organisations could be seen to be doing LIU of service users' lives for their own benefit. From a human-centric perspective, this grey area is situated as part of PDEC, as from the individual perspective, how organisations understand you through information will inform decisions that affect your life. Thus, this can be considered part of the reason why one might want to exert control over use of your data, rather than being part of exploiting data to gain self-insights and personal benefits.

[^19]: The illustrated processes assume reliance on existing data access processes such as GDPR, where the only access is through provision of a copy of one's data. This is in fact, not ideal, as it creates divergent versions and will quickly become out-of-sync, however for the sake of simplicity this inefficiency is ignored here. Improvements upon this approach are explored in [INSERT REF]

#### Life Information Utilisation

_**Life Information Utilisation**_ is a superset of _Self Informatics (SI)_ [2.2.3](#2.2.3). It includes all purposes relating to self-monitoring and self-improvement through data, but also includes all other uses of personal data including creative expression, evidence gathering, nostalgia, keeping, and sharing. Many of these desires were expressed in Case Study Two (see [Table 12](#table-12) in [5.3.3](#5.3.3)), and also hinted at in the Early Help context [[4.4.1](#4.4.1)]. While the existence of digitally-encoded information clearly unlocks new possibilities, LIU has existed in some form throughout human civilisation, as seen through analogue processes such as storytelling, journalling, scrapbooking, arts and crafts.

In the LIU context, the most important wants to focus on improving are _data understandability_ (6.1.2) and _data useability<sup>[15](#fn15)<sup>_ (6.1.3), which relate closely to the HDI concepts of _legibility_ and _agency_ respectively.

#### Personal Data Ecosystem Control

Unlike LIU, _**Personal Data Ecosystem Control**_ is an individual need that is new; arising as a result of the emergence of the data-centric world (2.1, 2.2.4). Only when organisations began to collect and store facts about people as a substitute for direct communication and involvement did it become necessary. The more data is collected about individuals, and the more parties collect and share that data, the greater the need for individuals to learn about that data so that they might influence its use (or risk their lives being affected in unexpected or potentially unfair ways). PDEC is a direct response to the power imbalance between data holders and individuals that the World Economic Forum described in 2014 [@wef2014lens;[2.1.2](#2.1.2)].

In the PDEC context, multiple data wants are important: visible data and transparent processes, as well as individual oversight and involvement. For simplicity, the former two wants can be referred to collectively as _"ecosystem transparency"_, and the latter two as _"ecosystem negotiability"_ (drawing on the HDI concept of _negotiability_), and these terms will be used below.

The landscape of opportunity: Obstacles to better Human Data Relations, and how we might overcome them{#7.3}
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![Figure X: Mapping the Six Wants into Objectives for the HDR Opportunity Landscape](./src/figs/figX-landscape-objectives.jpg)

In order to provide value to future researchers, activists and innovators, this chapter contributes a map of the HDR opportunity landscape. This map is expressed in two parts across this section and [7.4](#7.4). As a first step, we can take the "six wants from data relations" [Chapter 6](#chapter-6), and map reduce those to four simple _'landscape objectives'_ which shape our ultimate goals for effective HDR in this landscape of opportunity:

1. Data Awareness & Understanding;
2. Data Useability<sup>[15](#fn15)</sup>;
3. Ecosystem Awareness & Understanding and
4. Ecosystem Negotiability.

As [Figure X](#figure-X) shows, the need for data to be understandable, visible and useable, applies to all data, whether that data is interpretable as life information or ecosystem information.

Using these four objectives as our goals, and considering how they might be tackled, specific _obstacles_ have been identified. These are analogous to Li's 'barriers cascade' [[2.2.3](#2.2.3);#li2010] and represent the obstacles that individuals or system designers must be empowered to overcome if the objectives are to be met. These obstacles are followed by useful _insights_ I have identified that might help overcome those obstacles. This is summarised in [Figure X](#figure-X), which shows an HDR-specific barriers cascade: a route of overcoming obstacles through which individuals might be empowered and by which organisations might become more HDR-friendly.

![Figure X: Obstacles and Resulting Insights in the HDR Opportunity Landscape](./src/figs/figX-obstacles-insights-hdr-landscape.jpg)

The obstacles and insights on the diagram are explained in the following subsections (the last of which covers some of the more pervasive obstacles that apply to all of the previous four HDR objectives).

### An Approach to Improving HDR: Defending Autonomy and Nurturing the Information Landscape

MAIN POINT: That it is not just about Positive Change, there must also be Defensive Action, in the face of the active erosion of user autonomy (backref above diminishing agency). That this is an avenue of activist and grassroots work in its own right.

### An Approach to Improving HDR: Winning Hearts and Minds: Teaching, Championing and Selling the Vision

MAIN POINT: That the nature of pursuing Human Data Relations causes for a radical reconfiguration of today's data world. We need new systems (which means not only there need to be business drivers for those systems but also that existing organisations much choose or be compelled to invest in them), and people need to understand, use and see value in those systems.  Therefore, there needs to be specific investment:
SUBPOINT in Education, and Data Literacy
SUBPOINT in Systems Building (just ee above)
SUBPOINT in standards, information uniting the diaspora
SUBPOINT in Researching New Business Models and Demonstrating Value of transparency and human centricity
SUBPOINT in supporting Data Understanding Industry.
empowering individuals as investigators. Tools to map their own ecosystems and unite their own personal data diaspora.
FRAME AS DIAGRAM
Structural work in upper right - standards
Selling work in top level - show value to individuals
Selling work in top level - show value to organisations
Structural work in bottom right - systems
Individual work in top left - empower and educate individuals
all leading to new action of individuals in top right
ENDING: that this is not just a technical problem, and not just a case of building new things. It's about beginning and catalysing a cycle of constant feedback, of data enabled design and action research / iterative software and business model development - finding what works, championing it, selling it.
