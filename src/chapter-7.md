Case Study Three: Personal Data Interface Design & Development {#chapter-7}
=======================

    "The world is working exactly as designed. And it's not working very well. Which means we need to do a better job of designing it." ——_Mike Monteiro, author of 'Ruined by Design'_

In this chapter, which kicks off the second part of this thesis, I build upon the newfound understanding of the better human-data relations that people need and start to consider *how* these goals might be achieved in practice. This second part of the thesis aims to answer the third sub-research question RQ3: _'What challenges and opportunities exist for improving human data relations in practice?'_. While the exploration of this question has also been informed throughout the PhD by other research activities including my work within the SILVER project (see 3.4.1.1 and 3.4.3.2) and my work on web augmentation (3.4.3.2), RQ3 is largely and substantively examined through my third PhD Case Study, introduced below, in which I was remotely embedded for three months within a full-time internship into the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)'s Research and Development department, working with specialists, designers, researchers and developers on an exploratory research project codenamed 'Cornmarket' during the summer of 2021. I continued this involvement as a part-time research consultant and critical friend for a further 5 months after the conclusion of the initial three-month placement.
