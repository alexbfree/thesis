Answering RQ3: What are the challenges and opportunities?
---------------------------------------------------------

[What challenges and opportunities are relevant when attempting to meet the six wants of human data relations? - How the six wants fit into these two purposes]

### The Role of Personal Data

[Data as property, self, insight, medium, currency, expression, ...]

### Challenges and Opportunities in Life Information Utilisation

#### Understandable Data

##### Obstacles to Data Understandability

[Meaningfulness / relatability -> relate it to people/places/events]

[Context - Life - > need life interfaces]

[Information within Data -> Lack of Visualisations and Tools]

[Scatteredness -> holistic/unification, place to centralise]

[Complexity -> common formats/abstractions/summarisations]

##### Improving Data Understandability

[Personal data Stores as place to put stuff]

[Build systems to extract meaning - interpreting and combining signals]

[Use standards & semantics to convert data to life information]

[presenting and visualising life information]

#### Useable Data[^13]

[^13]: The words _'usability'_ and _'usable'_ (spelt without an 'e') most commonly refer to a judgement of the degree to which a website or user interface is easy to use. Throughout this thesis, I deliberately use the alternative word spellings of _'useability'_ and _'useable'_ [@dictUseability; @dictUseable] respectively, to clearly distinguish from this ease-of-use concept and to denote that I am referring a different meaning: the more literal definition, i.e. _"the quality or state of being convenient and practicable for use"_ [@dictUsability; @dictUsable]. Any usages without an 'e' can be taken to refer to the interface ease-of-use concept.

##### Obstacles to Data Useability

[Trapped Data -> Force unlocking of data through technical means or regulatory influence]

[Insufficient versatility -> enable questions, comparisons, investigations etc]


##### Improving Data Useability

[supporting useful actions on data - filtering, referencing, cross referencing, conjecturing/whatiffing]

[data as material, interface features as tools to use that material]

[supporting appropriation, annotation, organisation, curation, use & re-use]

[temporal, entity-based/relational and geographical exploration]

[support goal setting, tracking and reflection]

[an information operating system]

[asking tools rather than answers or insights]

##### Other Factors in Life Information Utilisation

[Motivation -> Showing the potential]

[Effort -> doing as much as possible automatically, conjecture and assertion over blank pages. training rather than meticulous instructution.]

[how the other wants fit in, visibility as it pertains to Life info, transparency/oversight/involvement etc]

[agency over trapped data (by tech or by companies (lead into next)]

### Challenges and Opportunities in Personal Data Ecosystem Control

#### Data Visibility and Process Transparency

##### Obstacles to Data Visibility and Process Transparency

[hidden data and closed processes -> closed by default thinking -> encourage or legislate for openness.. e.g. data portability/access rights, rights to explanatione etc, but more needed]

[silos and motives towards closed proprietary systems -> highlight the pains]

[lack of information *about* our data -> awareness and accountability even where access is difficult -> ]

[lack of standards, motivations against interoperability -> motivate standards and unconver opportunities for interoperability]

##### Improving Data Visibility and Process Transparency

[ecosystem visualisation and overviews]

[exploiting the seams - the battle for the seams]

[standards creation and the benefits of enabling a 'data understanding' industry]

[regulation - forcing openness transparency and interop. DSA ? ]

[collectives - as a means to exert individual power]

#### Ecosystem Negotiability

##### Obstacles to Ecosystem Negotiability

[structural power, resource control, centralisation etc -> uneven landscape -> awareness as first step and systemic change needed to change. ]

[the four levers of infrastructural power. accumulation of info/surveillance as power. changing available information/actions as power]

[data self affects you but cannot see (proxy for involvement, unseen inferences etc)- > find a way to produce better digital selves]

[Controlling the landscape of what is knowable, and what is do-able -> recognise the importance of free information landscapes, and make them happen through tech or through regulation]

##### Improving Ecosystem Negotiability

[better digital selves -> people as source of data. profiles and curated as better representation of self, ref past calls in C4&5 for stewardship, user-contributed data etc]

[collectives, supported by policy [uber, ref GDPR guidelines?]]

[the battle for landscape control]

[-> exploiting the seams in order to produce new information presentations... ref JE paper (+colin?) -> web aug, firefox containers]

[-> better policies? DSA?]

##### Other Factors in Personal Data Ecosystem Control

A Theory Of Change Perspective on Better Human Data Relations
-------------------------------------------------------------

[the four change quadrants for each of the two purposes. diagrams to work out].

Thesis Conclusion
-----------------

[reiterate the answer to the question - the key role, capabilities and approaches needed for better human data relations]

[clarify the contribution of the thesis, with backreferences]

[highlight future value/societal implications of the work]
