@techreport{WEF2014context,
abstract = {As part of its multi-year Rethinking Personal Data initiative, the World Economic Forum, in partnership with Microsoft, collaborated to understand the impact of context on individuals' attitudes towards personal data, and how to practically leverage this information to develop context-aware systems that can empower individuals. The research undertaken identified seven variables, both objective and subjective, that influence individuals' perception of a given personal data-use scenario. The study also examined individual demographic variables such as age and technological sophistication. Individuals were found to be particularly sensitive to four of the factors: collection method, data usage, trust in service provider and value exchange. Additionally, cultural and geographical factors influenced the relative importance of each variable. With a better understanding of the elements of context, data governance systems can be more user-centred and reflective of individual preferences. For example, “recommender systems” can help individuals with context-sensitive data settings by either allowing for expressed preferences on certain data settings or by making a recommendation on the individual's behalf.},

@article{hoofnagle2019,
abstract = {This paper introduces the strategic approach to regulating personal data and the normative foundations of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (‘GDPR'). We explain the genesis of the GDPR, which is best understood as an extension and refinement of existing requirements imposed by the 1995 Data Protection Directive; describe the GDPR's approach and provisions; and make predictions about the GDPR's implications. We also highlight where the GDPR takes a different approach than U.S. privacy law. The GDPR is the most consequential regulatory development in information policy in a generation. The GDPR brings personal data into a detailed regulatory regime, that will influence personal data usage worldwide. Understood properly, the GDPR encourages firms to develop information governance frameworks, to in-house data use, and to keep humans in the loop in decision making. Companies with direct relationships with consumers have strategic advantages under the GDPR, compared to third party advertising firms on the internet. To reach these objectives, the GDPR uses big sticks, structural elements that make proving violations easier, but only a few carrots. The GDPR will complicate and restrain some information intensive business models. But the GDPR will also enable approaches previously impossible under less-protective approaches.},
