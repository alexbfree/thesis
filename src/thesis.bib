@article{mccullagh2009,
abstract = {The development of a frontier-free internal market and of the so-called ‘information society' have resulted in an increase in the flow of personal data between EU member states. To remove potential obstacles to such transfers, data protection legislation was introduced. One of the underpinning principles of Directive 95/46/ EC is the protection of privacy. Yet, the legislation does not provide a conclusive understanding of the terms ‘privacy' or ‘private' data. Rather, privacy protection is to be achieved through the regulation of the conditions under which personal data may be processed. An assessment of whether, 10 years after the enactment of the Data Protection Act 1998 (DPA 1998), a coherent understanding of the concept of personal data exists, necessitated an analysis of the decisions in Durant v. FSA ([2003] EWCA Civ 1746) and CSA v. SIC ([2008] 1 WLR 1550, [2008] UKHL 47). Furthermore, in order to examine the effectiveness of the legislation, this article examines whether the term ‘personal' is synonymous with the term ‘private' data and whether control over processing of personal information protects privacy. By drawing on interviews with privacy and data protection experts, and from the findings of a survey of bloggers, it will be shown that a review of the assumptions and concepts underpinning the legislation is necessary.},

One of the many effects the Internet has had has been to massively increase the number and types of organisation relationships individuals need to manage; and by default, they do most of that online. The chart below shows how this has evolved over time; the initial sample (Royal Mail, UK, 1997) was large scale and robust and that has been repeated less formally since then. What is clear today, individuals have to deal with a much greater volume than before, and without tools on their side to support them.

abstract = {As part of its multi-year Rethinking Personal Data initiative, the World Economic Forum, in partnership with Microsoft, collaborated to understand the impact of context on individuals' attitudes towards personal data, and how to practically leverage this information to develop context-aware systems that can empower individuals. The research undertaken identified seven variables, both objective and subjective, that influence individuals' perception of a given personal data-use scenario. The study also examined individual demographic variables such as age and technological sophistication. Individuals were found to be particularly sensitive to four of the factors: collection method, data usage, trust in service provider and value exchange. Additionally, cultural and geographical factors influenced the relative importance of each variable. With a better understanding of the elements of context, data governance systems can be more user-centred and reflective of individual preferences. For example, “recommender systems” can help individuals with context-sensitive data settings by either allowing for expressed preferences on certain data settings or by making a recommendation on the individual's behalf.},

We explain the genesis of the GDPR, which is best understood as an extension and refinement of existing requirements imposed by the 1995 Data Protection Directive; describe the GDPR's approach and provisions; and make predictions about the GDPR's implications. We also highlight where the GDPR takes a different approach than U.S. privacy law. The GDPR is the most consequential regulatory development in information policy in a generation. The GDPR brings personal data into a detailed regulatory regime, that will influence personal data usage worldwide. Understood properly, the GDPR encourages firms to develop information governance frameworks, to in-house data use, and to keep humans in the loop in decision-making. Companies with direct relationships with consumers have strategic advantages under the GDPR, compared to third party advertising firms on the internet. To reach these objectives, the GDPR uses big sticks, structural elements that make proving violations easier, but only a few carrots. The GDPR will complicate and restrain some information intensive business models. But the GDPR will also enable approaches previously impossible under less-protective approaches.},

The widespread practice of user agreements and consent-based regulation of personal data collection is not satisfactory for balancing these information-asymmetric markets. The lack of transparency deriving from the complex and massive datafication of consumers – where consumers are profiled, data is brokered and the algorithmically automated decision-making is opaque – speaks to the need for improved supervision at a more structural level above and beyond the individual consumer's choices, preferably by more active consumer protection authorities.},

@article{spiekermann2017,
abstract = {Analysts, investors and entrepreneurs have recognized the value of personal data for Internet economics. Personal data is viewed as 'the oil' of the digital economy. Yet, ordinary people are barely aware of this. Marketers collect personal data at minimal cost in exchange for free services. But will this be possible in the long term, especially in the face of privacy concerns? Little is known about how users really value their personal data. In this paper, we build a user-centered value theory for personal data. On the basis of a survey experiment with 1269 Facebook users, we identify core constructs that drive the value of volunteered personal data. We find that privacy concerns are less influential than expected and influence data value mainly when people become aware of data markets. In fact, the consciousness of data being a tradable asset is the single most influential factor driving willingness-to-pay for data. Furthermore, we find that people build a sense of psychological ownership for their data and hence value it more. Finally, our value theory helps to unveil market design mechanisms that will influence how personal data markets thrive: First, we observe a majority of users become reactant if they are consciously deprived of control over their personal data; many drop out of the market. We therefore advice companies to consider user-centered data control tools to have them participate in personal data markets. Second, we find that in order to create scarcity in the market, centralized IT architectures (reducing multiple data copies) may be beneficial.},

abstract = {This paper presents a modified diary study that investigated how people performed personally motivated searches in their email, in their files, and on the Web. Although earlier studies of directed search focused on keyword search, most of the search behavior we observed did not involve keyword search. Instead of jumping directly to their information target using keywords, our participants navigated to their target with small, local steps using their contextual knowledge as a guide, even when they knew exactly what they were looking for in advance. This stepping behavior was especially common for participants with unstructured information organization. The observed advantages of searching by taking small steps include that it allowed users to specify less of their information need and provided a context in which to understand their results. We discuss the implications of such advantages for the design of personal information management tools.},

@article{krishnan2005,
abstract = {Users' personal information spaces are characterized by their content, organisation, and ongoing user interaction with them. They are fluid entities, evolving over time, and supporting multiple user activities that may require different perspectives of the same underlying information structure. Increasing storage capacity of computing devices and ready access to networked resources puts users at risk of information overload, and presents increasing challenges in organising and accessing their information. The hierarchical model of information organisation currently dominates personal computing, and is realised for the user in interfaces that help to manage and access filestore hierarchies. Such a model provides limited inherent support for what users do—carry out a range of interleaved activities over time. In this paper, we describe the TimeSpace system, which provides perspectives on a user's information resources based on activities and temporal attributes of the information. TimeSpace can be used alongside, or in place of, existing systems and models (such as the Microsoft Windows hierarchical file model). User interaction with an information space is non-intrusively observed and then represented automatically in TimeSpace. Visualisations provide overviews of user activity on multiple projects and detailed views of activity within particular projects, allowing navigation forward and backward in time. An observational study of use of the system revealed positive user views of the utility of temporal, activity-oriented workspaces in real world contexts alongside existing tools. Participants appreciated being offered a different perspective on their electronic information collection, one that visually shows the composition and development of their information space. They were interested in using the system for current and long-term work as well as for archiving information, as the visualisations provide a context for their work and give an overview of all their work in progress. The ideas embodied by the system and its visualisations show promise and raise a number of issues for further exploration. In future work, these ideas will be adapted and extended to support users in managing their information spaces across multiple personal devices, locations and time.},

@article{abowd2000,
abstract = {The proliferation of computing into the physical world promises more than the ubiquitous availability of computing infrastructure; it suggests new paradigms of interaction inspired by constant access to information and computational capabilities. For the past decade, application-driven research in ubiquitous computing (ubicomp) has pushed three interaction themes: natural interfaces, context-aware applications, and automated capture and access. To chart a course for future research in ubiquitous computing, we review the accomplishments of these efforts and point to remaining research challenges. Research in ubiquitous computing implicitly requires addressing some notion of scale, whether in the number and type of devices, the physical space of distributed computing, or the number of people using a system. We posit a new area of applications research, everyday computing, focussed on scaling interaction with respect to time. Just as pushing the availability of computing away from the traditional desktop fundamentally changes the relationship between humans and computers, providing continuous interaction moves computing from a localized tool to a constant companion. Designing for continuous interaction requires addressing interruption and resumption of interaction, representing passages of time and providing associative storage models. Inherent in all of these interaction themes are difficult issues in the social implications of ubiquitous computing and the challenges of evaluating ubiquitous computing research. Although cumulative experience points to lessons in privacy, security, visibility, and control, there are no simple guidelines for steering research efforts. Akin to any efforts involving new technologies, evaluation strategies form a spectrum from technology feasibility efforts to long-term use studies-but a user-centric perspective is always possible and necessary. {\textcopyright} 2000, ACM.

abstract = {As Director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development, Dr. Vannevar Bush has coordinated the activities of some six thousand leading American scientists in the application of science to warfare. In this significant article he holds up an incentive for scientists when the fighting has ceased. He urges that men of science should then turn to the massive task of making more accessible our bewildering store of knowledge. For many years inventions have extended man's physical powers rather than the powers of his mind. Trip hammers that multiply the fists, microscopes that sharpen the eye, and engines of destruction and detection are new results, but not the end results, of modern science. Now, says Dr. Bush, instruments are at hand which, if properly developed, will give man access to and command over the inherited knowledge of the ages. The perfection of these pacific instruments should be the first objective of our scientists as they emerge from their war work. Like Emerson's famous address of 1837 on “The American Scholar,'' this paper by Dr. Bush calls for a new relationship between thinking man and the sum of our knowledge.},

This paper illustrates how many of the issues involved in the automation of information management are essentially psychological in nature. These principally devolve upon the processes of recall, recognition and categorisation. Examples of existing information management techniques show how there is a trend to automate with a view to simulating office practices, or to develop according to the availability of technological solutions. Both of these are inefficient with respect to the user's psychological needs. A framework for developing user-oriented information management systems is discussed and relevant research issues presented. {\textcopyright} 1988.},

abstract = {We explored general issues concerning personal information management by investigating the characteristics of office workers' paper-based information, in an industrial research environment. We examined the reasons people collect paper, types of data they collect, problems encountered in handling paper, and strategies used for processing it. We tested three specific hypotheses in the course of an office move. The greater availability of public digital data along with changes in people's jobs or interests should lead to wholescale discarding of paper data, while preparing for the move. Instead we found workers kept large, highly valued paper archives. We also expected that the major part of people's personal archives would be unique documents. However, only 49% of people's archives were unique documents, the remainder being copies of publicly available data and unread information, and we explore reasons for this. We examined the effects of paper-processing strategies on archive structure. We discovered different paper-processing strategies (filing and piling) that were relatively independent of job type. We predicted that filers' attempts to evaluate and categorize incoming documents would produce smaller archives that were accessed frequently. Contrary to our predictions, filers amassed more information, and accessed it less frequently than pilers. We argue that filers may engage in premature filing: to clear their workspace, they archive information that later turns out to be of low value. Given the effort involved in organizing data, they are also loath to discard filed information, even when its value is uncertain. We discuss the implications of this research for digital personal information management. {\textcopyright} 2001, ACM. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Document properties are a compelling infrastructure on which to develop document management applications. A property-based approach avoids many of the problems of traditional hierarchical storage mechanisms, reflects document organizations meaningful to user tasks, provides a means to integrate the perspectives of multiple individuals and groups, and does this all within a uniform interaction framework. Document properties can reflect not only categorizations of documents and document use, but also expressions of desired system activity, such as sharing criteria, replication management, and versioning. Augmenting property-based document management systems with active properties that carry executable code enables the provision of document-based services on a property infrastructure. The combination of document properties as a uniform mechanism for document management, and active properties as a way of delivering document services, represents a new paradigm for document management infrastructures. The Placeless Documents system is an experimental prototype developed to explore this new paradigm. It is based on the seamless integration of user-specific, active properties. We present the fundamental design approach, explore the challenges and opportunities it presents, and show how our architecture deals with them.},

abstract = {Appropriation is the process by which people adopt and adapt technologies, fitting them into their working practices. It is similar to customisation, but concerns the adoption patterns of technology and the transformation of practice at a deeper level. Understanding appropriation is a key problem for developing interactive systems, since it critical to the success of technology deployment. It is also an important research issue, since appropriation lies at the intersection of workplace studies and design. Most accounts of appropriation in the research literature have taken a social perspective. In contrast, this paper explores appropriation in terms of the technical features that support it. Draw- ing examples from applications developed as part of a novel document management system, it develops an initial set of design principles for appropriable technologies. These principles are particu- larly relevant to component-based approaches to system design that blur the traditional application boundaries.},

abstract = {Folder navigation is the main way that personal computer users retrieve their own files. People dedicate consider- able time to creating systematic structures to facilitate such retrieval. Despite the prevalence of both manual organization and navigation, there is very little system- atic data about how people actually carry out navigation, or about the relation between organization structure and retrieval parameters.The aims of our research were there- fore to study users' folder structure, personal file nav- igation, and the relations between them. We asked 296 participants to retrieve 1,131 of their active files and analyzed each of the 5,035 navigation steps in these retrievals. Folder structures were found to be shallow (files were retrieved frommeandepth of 2.86 folders),with small folders (a mean of 11.82 files per folder) contain- ing many subfolders (M=10.64). Navigation was largely successful and efficient with participants successfully accessing 94% of their files and taking 14.76 seconds to do this on average. Retrieval time and success depended on folder size and depth. We therefore found the users' decision to avoid both deep structure and large folders to be adaptive. Finally, we used a predictive model to formulate the effect of folder depth and folder size on retrieval time, and suggested an optimization point in this trade-off.},

abstract = {There is considerable interest in the question of how users can be supported in the management of large information systems. Existing systems are perceived as being difficult to use, and future systems will handle very much more information than at present, exacerbating the problem. This paper describes a prototype interface, MEMOIRS (Managing Episodic Memory for Office Information Retrieval Systems), which is designed to support the management of personal information in a new way. This approach treats a personal filing system as a history of events (of which documents are a particular type), and focuses upon user's recall for those events. MEMOIRS therefore exemplifies a mnemonic support system which aims to optimize performance in two ways: It aims to improve user's recall for the information they have handled; and it is also designed to exploit as much of what is recalled as possible. The rationale behind this approach is discussed and a broad specification of the system presented, with examples of MEMOIRS in use. The approach is compared and contrasted with other filing systems based upon models of human memory which are associative, rather than event-driven, in character. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

Through a conceptual and design-led exploration of new file metaphors, we developed the 'file biography', a digital entity that encompasses the provenance of a file and allows the user to keep track of how it propagates. We explored this through prototyping and utilised it in two user studies. In the studies, we (i) asked people to sketch out file biographies for their own content, and (ii) deployed a tool enabling users to build their own simple file biographies across multiple versions of Word documents. We conclude that new file metaphors may need to play different roles for different types of digital content, with a distinction being drawn between content that is 'in production' and virtual possessions that are, in a sense, a 'finished' artefact.},

@techreport{abowd2000,
abstract = {The proliferation of computing into the physical world promises more than the ubiquitous availability of computing infrastructure; it suggests new paradigms of interaction inspired by constant access to information and computational capabilities. For the past decade, application driven research in ubiquitous computing (ubicomp) has pushed three interaction themes: natural interfaces, context-aware applications, and automated capture and access. To chart a course for future research in ubiquitous computing, we review the accomplishments of these efforts and point to remaining research challenges. Research in ubiquitous computing implicitly requires addressing some notion of scale, whether in the number and type of devices, the physical space of distributed computing, or the number of people using a system. We posit a new area of applications research, everyday computing, focussed on scaling interaction with respect to time. Just as pushing the availability of computing away from the traditional desktop fundamentally changes the relationship between humans and computers, providing continuous interaction moves computing from a localized tool to a constant companion. Designing for continuous interaction requires addressing interruption and resumption of interaction, representing passages of time and providing associative storage models. Inherent in all of these interaction themes are difficult issues in the social implications of ubiquitous computing and the challenges of evaluating ubiquitous computing research. Although cumulative experience points to lessons in privacy, security, visibility, and control, there are no simple guidelines for steering research efforts. Akin to any efforts involving new technologies, evaluation strategies form a spectrum from technology feasibility efforts to long-term use studies-but a user-centric perspective is always possible and necessary.},

Traditionally, HCI has taken place within a constrained and well-understood domain of experience - single users sitting at desks and interacting with conventionally-designed computers employing screens, keyboards and mice for interaction. New opportunities have engendered considerable interest in "context-aware computing" - computational systems that can sense and respond to aspects of the settings in which they are used. However, considerable confusion surrounds the notion of "context" - what it means, what it includes and what role it plays in interactive systems. This paper suggests that the representational stance implied by conventional interpretations of "context" misinterprets the role of context in everyday human activity, and proposes an alternative model that suggests different directions for design. {\textcopyright} 2004 Springer-Verlag London Limited.},

In addition, we introduce the idea of context spaces that users can directly interact with and work on. To make them available in all applications without further ado, the system is transparently integrated using mostly standard protocols complemented by a sidebar for advanced features. By exploiting collected context information and applying Managed Forgetting features (like hiding, condensation or deletion), the system is able to dynamically reorganize itself, which also includes a kind of tidy-up-itself functionality. We therefore expect it to be more scalable while providing new levels of user support. An early prototype has been implemented and is presented in this demo.},

There were few effects for improved search. First, regardless of search engine, there was a strong navigation preference: on average, users estimated that they used navigation for 56 - 68% of file retrieval events but searched for only 4 - 15% of events. Second, the effect of improving the quality of the search engine on search usage was limited and inconsistent. Third, search was used mainly as a last resort when users could not remember file location. Finally, there was no evidence that using improved desktop search engines leads people to change their filing habits to become less reliant on hierarchical file organization. We conclude by offering theoretical explanations for navigation preference, relating to differences between PIM and Internet retrieval, and suggest alternative design directions for PIM systems. {\textcopyright} 2008 ACM.},

abstract = {In this article we suggest a user-subjective approach to Personal Information Management (PIM) system design. This approach advocates that PIM systems relate to the subjective value-added attributes that the user gives to the data stored in the PIM system. These attributes should facilitate system use: help the user find the information item again, recall it when needed, and use it effectively in the next interaction with the item. Driven from the user-subjective approach are three generic principles which are described and discussed: (a) The subjective classification principle, stating that all information items related to the same subjective topic should be classified together regardless of their technological format; (b) The subjective importance principle, proposing that the subjective importance of information should determine its degree of visual salience and accessibility; and (c) The subjective context principle, suggesting that information should be retrieved and viewed by the user in the same context in which it was previously used. We claim that these principles are only sporadically implemented in operating systems currently available on personal computers, and demonstrate alternatives for interface design.},

The challenge in displaying this information is to discover how the user's context can be maintained while giving her access to the new information that becomes available. The user should feel in control of the information despite the fact that it is changing. This can be done effectively by understanding what conceptual anchors the user creates into the data, and keeping them constant while changing the other information as needed.

Soon, if you choose, you will be able to conveniently and affordably record your whole life in minute detail. You would have Total Recall. Authors Gordon Bell and Jim Gemmell draw on experience from their MyLifeBits project at Microsoft Research to explain the benefits to come from an earth-shaking and inevitable increase in electronic memories. In 1998 they began using Bell, a luminary in the computer world, as a test case, attempting to digitally record as much of his life as possible. Photos, letters, and memorabilia were scanned. Everything he did on his computer was captured. He wore an automatic camera, an arm-strap that logged his bio-metrics, and began recording telephone calls. This experiment, and the system created to support it, put them at the center of a movement studying the creation and enjoyment of e-memories. Since then the three streams of technology feeding the Total Recall revolution-digital recording, digital storage, and digital search, have become gushing torrents. We are capturing so much of our lives now, be it on the date-and location-stamped photos we take with our smart phones or in the continuous records we have of our emails, instant messages, and tweets-not to mention the GPS tracking of our movements many cars and smart phones do automatically. We are storing what we capture either out there in the "cloud" of services such as Facebook or on our very own increasingly massive and cheap hard drives. But the critical technology, and perhaps least understood, is our magical new ability to find the information we want in the mountain of data that is our past. And not just Google it, but data mine it so that, say, we can chart how much exercise we have been doing in the last four weeks in comparison with what we did four years ago. In health, education, work life, and our personal lives, the Total Recall revolution is going to change everything. As Bell and Gemmell show, it has already begun. Total Recall provides a glimpse of the near future. Imagine heart monitors woven into your clothes and tiny wearable audio and visual recorders automatically capturing what you see and hear. Imagine being able to summon up the e-memories of your great grandfather and his avatar giving you advice about whether or not to go to college, accept that job offer, or get married. The range of potential insights is truly awesome. But Bell and Gemmell also show how you can begin to take better advantage of this new technology right now. From how to navigate the serious questions of privacy and serious problem of application compatibility to what kind of startups Bell is willing to invest in and which scanner he prefers, this is a book about a turning point in human knowledge as well as an immediate and practical guide. Total Recall is a technological revolution that will accomplish nothing less than a transformation in the way humans think about the meaning of their lives. {\^{A}}What would happen if we could instantly access all the information we were exposed to throughout our lives?{\^{A}} {\^{A}}Bill Gates, from the Foreword},

Users must interact with the system in at least one of the phases for users to become aware of their behavior. In my proposed work, I focus on user's interaction with the system during the monitoring phase. The main question of my research is what are the problems with the monitoring phase of personal informatics and how can they be re-solved?

abstract = {People strive to obtain self-knowledge. A class of systems called personal informatics is appearing that help people collect and reflect on personal information. However, there is no comprehensive list of problems that users experience using these systems, and no guidance for making these systems more effective. To address this, we conducted surveys and interviews with people who collect and reflect on personal information. We derived a stage-based model of personal informatics systems composed of five stages (preparation, collection, integration, reflection, and action) and identified barriers in each of the stages. These stages have four essential properties: barriers cascade to later stages; they are iterative; they are user-driven and/or system-driven; and they are uni-faceted or multi-faceted. From these properties, we recommend that personal informatics systems should 1) be designed in a holistic manner across the stages; 2) allow iteration between stages; 3) apply an appropriate balance of automated technology and user control within each stage to facilitate the user experience; and 4) explore support for associating multiple facets of people's lives to enrich the value of systems.},

These effects were moderated by the nature of the introspective activity (Experiment 3) and by its duration (Experiment 4).

In the 29 physically identical 3-bedroom homes used in the study, central air conditioning was the largest single source of electricity usage during the summer. Accordingly, it was possible to predict the household's expected electricity consumption in terms of the average daily outdoor temperature. Feedback was expressed as a percentage of actual consumption over predicted consumption, and it was displayed to the homeowners 4 times/wk for approximately 1 mo. Results confirm the hypothesis. Before feedback began, the feedback and control groups were consuming electricity at approximately equal rates. During the feedback period, the feedback group used 10.5% less electricity. The effectiveness of the feedback procedure is discussed in terms of its cuing, motivational, and commitment functions.

abstract = {This paper presents a framework for technical support of reflective learning. This is derived from a unification of theory on reflective learning with a conceptual framework of Quantified Self tools. Reflective learning means returning to and evaluating past work performances and personal experiences in order to promote continuous learning and improve future experiences. However, theories of reflective learning do not sufficiently consider technical support. Quantified Self (QS) is a collaboration of users who use and develop a variety of tools to collect personally relevant information with the purpose of gaining self-knowledge about one's behaviors, habits and thoughts. Hence, QS approaches, including mobile devices, sensors and social applications, offer a rich source of data that has not been available for learning processes before. However, these are rather experimental approaches and currently there is no unifying framework that clusters and connects these many emergent tools with the goals and benefits of their use. This paper brings these two strands into one unified framework that shows how QS approaches can support reflective learning processes on the one hand and how reflective learning can inform the design of new QS tools for informal learning purposes on the other hand.},

The increasingly popular activity tracking technology (ATT) has given rise to a new type of personal information about one's daily physical activities, which has not been scrutinized under theoretical frameworks in PIM. This article presents an in-depth qualitative interview study supplemented by participant-driven photo elicitation with 20 long-term activity tracker users about how they manage personal information generated by ATT. Key findings include the identification of two distinctive user groups (i.e., consistent casual users and powers users) among long-term activity tracker users and an in-depth portrayal of these groups' PIM behaviors with ATT. These behaviors include concurrent and subsequent PIM practices, 6 types of PIM activities, and the use of a spectrum of PIM tools. This research provides timely theoretical updates to PIM under the background of self-tracking technologies, outlines empirical implications to improve ATT in support of PIM, and offers recommendations for incorporating participant-driven photo elicitation as a supplementary method for qualitative interviews in information behavior research.},

Then, we develop lightweight, interactive visualizations that effectively summarize quantitative data related to users' behavior patterns and routines, thus, facilitating them in self-monitoring and reflection-after-action process. As a final step we deliver personalized feedback and behavior change interventions for promoting positive behavior changes amongst the users.

abstract = {As a response to the call for theoretical perspectives on how to move human-computer interaction closer to the human and remove barriers to flexibility, I outline that a key part of the solution involves changing the way we model, and think about, our data – that we must build for the totality of individuals' digital lives, and in recognition of the increasing complexity that keeps our data scattered and trapped within data formats, services, devices and file formats. We must create a new genre of free data interaction interfaces that allow productive interaction with our personal data at an abstracted, platform-and technology-independent level. Data should be indexed represented with proxies where needed rather than favoring centralized storage. Interaction metaphors such as lifestreams, semantic dashboards and locational interfaces are proposed. Technologists and designers must work together to build useful applications that users can operate at a semantic, not technology-centric, level.},

abstract = {While users' discontinuance of use has posed a challenge for social media in recent years, there is a paucity of knowledge on the relationships between different dimensions of overload and how overload adversely affects users' social media discontinuance behaviors. To address this knowledge gap, this study employed the stressor–strain–outcome (SSO) framework to explain social media discontinuance behaviors from an overload perspective. It also conceptualized social media overload as a multidimensional construct consisting of system feature overload, information overload, and social overload. The proposed research model was empirically validated via 412 valid questionnaire responses collected from Facebook users. Our results indicated that the three types of overload are interconnected through system feature overload. System feature overload, information overload, and social overload engender user exhaustion, which in turn leads to users' discontinued usage of social media. This study extends current technostress research by demonstrating the value of the SSO perspective in explaining users' social media discontinuance.},

abstract = {The value of information in the knowledge economy is indisputable, but so is its capacity to overwhelm consumers of it. HBR contributing editor Hemp reports on practical ways for individuals and organizations to avoid getting too much of a good thing. Ready access to useful information comes at a cost: As the volume increases, the line between the worthwhile and the distracting starts to blur. And ready access to you—via e-mail, social networking, and so on—exacerbates the situation: On average, Intel executives get 300 e-mails a day, and Microsoft workers need 24 minutes to return to work after each e-mail interruption. Clearly, productivity is taking a hit. Technological aids can help, such as e-mail management software for you, a message-volume regulation system for your organization, or even more-sophisticated solutions being developed by Microsoft, IBM, and others. Yet, battling technological interruptions on their own turf only goes so far. You also need to change your mind-set, perhaps by seeking help from personal-productivity experts or by simply accepting that you can't respond to every distraction that flits across your screen. Similarly, organizations must change their cultures, for instance by establishing clear e-communication protocols. In the end, only a multipronged approach will help you and your organization subdue the multiheaded monster of information overload. The secret is to manage the beast while still respecting it for the beautiful creature it is.},

In this paper, we explore the concept of social sensemaking. In contrast to high-level statistics, we posit that social networking and reciprocal sharing of fine-grained self-tracker data can provide valuable context for individuals in making sense of their data. We present the design of an online platform called Citizense Makers (CM), which facilitates group sharing, annotating and discussion of self-tracker data. In a field trial of CM, we explore design issues around willingness to share data reciprocally; the importance of familiarity between individuals; and understandings of common activities in contextualising one's own data.},

DLT and DFS are used to manage data sensed by mobile users equipped with devices with sensing capability. DLTs guarantee the immutability, traceability and verifiability of references to personal data, that are stored in DFS. In fact, the inclusion of data digests in the DLT makes it possible to obtain an unalterable reference and a tamper-proof log, while remaining compliant with the regulations on personal data, i.e. GDPR. We provide an experimental evaluation on the feasibility of the use of DFS. Three different scenarios have been studied: i) a proprietary IPFS approach with a dedicated node interfacing with the data producers, ii) a public IPFS service and iii) Sia Skynet. Results show that through proper configuration of the system infrastructure, it is viable to build a decentralized Personal Data Storage (PDS).},

Theory focused on work settings and interaction within well-established communities of practice. Situated action, distributed cognition, and activity theory were important sources of theoretical reflection, and concepts like context came into focus in the analysis and design of human-computer interaction. Proactive methods, such as a variety of participatory design workshops, prototyping, and contextual inquiries, were added to the toolbox. In the third wave, the use contexts and application Almost 10 years ago I gave a keynote at NordiCHI in which I discussed the second and third waves of HCI [1]. I chose the topic due to a general frustration over whether the third wave was about to throw out the baby with the bath water, discarding what was useful in the second wave. Here is my interpretation of the three waves: The first wave was cognitive science and human factors. It was model-driven and focused on the human being as a subject to be studied through rigid guidelines, formal methods, and systematic testing, as discussed by Liam Bannon [2]. He talked about the move to the second wave as that},

abstract = {A motivation behind much UbiComp research has been to make our lives convenient, comfortable and informed, following in the footsteps of Weiser's calm computing vision. Three themes that have dominated are context awareness, ambient intelligence and monitoring/tracking. While these avenues of research have been fruitful their accomplishments do not match up to anything like Weiser's world. This paper discusses why this is so and argues that is time for a change of direction in the field. An alternative agenda is outlined that focuses on engaging rather than calming people. Humans are very resourceful at exploiting their environments and extending their capabilities using existing strategies and tools. I describe how pervasive technologies can be added to the mix, outlining three areas of practice where there is much potential for professionals and laypeople alike to combine, adapt and use them in creative and constructive ways.},

At the 21st anniversary of that published vision, I want to assess ubicomp's maturity and explore the identity challenge it faces. Today, ubicomp as a niche research topic no longer makes sense; we must celebrate its "disappearance" as a well-scoped research agenda because it has become a profound agenda across most of computing, and beyond. This should not be surprising; the 2nd generation of computing, the personal computer revolution, experienced the same profound disappearance. In celebration of this imminent disappearance, I will highlight the unique contributions of the ubicomp community, express some remaining intellectual challenges, and speculate on how to formulate new visions of computing that might succeed this third generation.},

Since the emergence of the research fields of Computer supported cooperative work and Ubiquitous computing, the notion of context has been discussed from different theoretical approaches and in different research traditions. One of these approaches is Embodied Interaction. This theoretical approach has in particular contributed to (i) challenge the view that user context can be meaningfully represented by a computer system, (ii) discuss the notion of context as interaction through the idea that users are always embodied in their interaction with computer systems. We believe that the particular view on users context that the approach of Embodied Interaction suggests needs to be further elaborated in terms of design. As a contribution we suggest an integrated approach where the interactional view of Embodied Interaction is interrelated with the representational view of Context-aware computing. {\textcopyright} 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

It is particularly important for applications where the user's context is changing rapidly , such as in both handheld and ubiquitous computing. In order to better understand how we can use context and facilitate the building of context-aware applications, we need to more fully understand what constitutes a context-aware application and what context is. Towards this goal, we have surveyed existing work in context-aware computing. In this paper, we provide an overview of the results of this survey and, in particular, definitions and categories of context and context-aware. We conclude with recommendations for how this better understanding of context inform a framework for the development of context-aware applications.},

However, the value of these innovations is difficult to quantify, because consumers pay nothing to use them. We develop a new framework to measure the value of free services using the insight that even when people do not pay cash, they must still pay "attention," or time. Using our model, we estimate the increase in consumer surplus created by free internet services to be over $100 billion per year in the U.S. alone. Our analysis implies that most of welfare gain from digital services on the Internet would be overlooked by traditional approaches that rely only on the direct expenditures of money. Considering the time spent on consumption, as we do, makes it possible to assess the full value of these digital innovations.},

It marked the latest step in a journey that I began in the 1990's, when I first focused on enlisting the support of technologies that could enhance privacy. Back then, privacy protection relied primarily upon legislation and regulatory frameworks-in an effort to offer remedies for data breaches, after they had occurred. As information technology became increasingly interconnected and the volume of personal information collected began to explode, it became clear that a new way of thinking about privacy was needed. Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs) paved the way for that new direction, highlighting how the universal principles of fair information practices could be reflected in information and communication technologies to achieve strong privacy protection. While the idea seemed radical at the time, 1 it has been very gratifying over the past 15 years to see it come into widespread usage as part of the vocabulary of both privacy and information technology professionals. But the privacy landscape continues to evolve. So, like the technologies that shape and reshape the world in which we live, the privacy conversation must},

@book{searls2012,
abstract = {While marketers look for more ways to get personal with customers, including new tricks with "big data," customers are about to get personal in their own ways, with their own tools. Soon consumers will be able to: (1) Control the flow and use of personal data, (2) Build their own loyalty programs, (3) Dictate their own terms of service, and (4)Tell whole markets what they want, how they want it, where and when they should be able to get it, and how much it should cost. And they will do all of this outside of any one vendor's silo. This new landscape we're entering is what Doc Searls calls "The Intention Economy"--one in which demand will drive supply far more directly, efficiently, and compellingly than ever before. In this book he describes an economy driven by consumer intent, where vendors must respond to the actual intentions of customers instead of vying for the attention of many. New customer tools will provide the engine, with VRM (Vendor Relationship Management) providing the consumer counterpart to vendors' CRM (Customer Relationship Management) systems. For example, imagine being able to change your address once for every company you deal with, or combining services from multiple companies in real time, in your own ways--all while keeping an auditable accounting of every one of your interactions in the marketplace. These tantalizing possibilities and many others are introduced in this book. As customers become more independent and powerful, and the Intention Economy emerges, only vendors and organizations that are ready for the change will survive, and thrive. Where do you stand?

@article{taylor2017,
abstract = {The increasing availability of digital data reflecting economic and human development, and in particular the availability of data emitted as a by-product of people's use of technological devices and services, has both political and practical implications for the way people are seen and treated by the state and by the private sector. Yet the data revolution is so far primarily a technical one: the power of data to sort, categorise and intervene has not yet been explicitly connected to a social justice agenda by the agencies and authorities involved. Meanwhile, although data-driven discrimination is advancing at a similar pace to data processing technologies, awareness and mechanisms for combating it are not. This paper posits that just as an idea of justice is needed in order to establish the rule of law, an idea of data justice – fairness in the way people are made visible, represented and treated as a result of their production of digital data – is necessary to determine ethical paths through a datafying world. Bringing together the emerging scholarly perspectives on this topic, I propose three pillars as the basis of a notion of international data justice: (in)visibility, (dis)engagement with technology and antidiscrimination. These pillars integrate positive with negative rights and freedoms, and by doing so challenge both the basis of current data protection regulations and the growing assumption that being visible through the data we emit is part of the contemporary social contract.},

@article{guba1990,
abstract = {"The contributors and editor of this work are to be commended for their successful efforts in delineating many of the concerns current within education and in calling for frank debate on these issues by all interested parties. Furthermore, they have stimulated good scholarship by readily admitting to the current state of affairs being one of more questions than answers and more confusion than clarity. They thus remind us that the search for knowledge is one fraught with conflict in a public arena. "The appropriate audience for this volume is assessed to be the reader who derives satisfaction from critical thinking. It would be appropriate for graduate students in education, human services, social sciences, or theology, or any person committed to the endeavor and process of education. "The Paradigm Dialog is one of those rare books that simultaneously stretches the mind while projecting one into self-reflection. For the applied practitioner, whether teacher, counselor, or consultant, the possibility of gaining further insight into the underlying assumptions which constrain one's pedagogy or practice is highly possible upon a critical reading." -The Journal of Applied Rehabilitation Counseling Is scientific positivism, long the reigning paradigm for research in the social sciences, the "best way" to conduct social research? This is the central question examined in The Paradigm Dialog. Recently three key challengers have appeared-postpositivism, critical theory, and constructivism. All three offer researchers new methodological approaches, and all three present fundamental questions that must be addressed. Can research be conducted between paradigms? Are they equally useful in answering questions of applied research? What constitutes good, or ethical, research in each? In this volume, these and other significant questions are examined by a multidisciplinary group of leading figures in qualitative research. Not surprisingly, there is no agreement on the "best" paradigm question, but the dialog offered in this compelling volume deftly explores important issues in selecting the proper paradigm for tackling a variety of research questions. With a group of contributors that reads like a veritable who's who in qualitative research, The Paradigm Dialog is a must for anyone conducting research in the social sciences.},

abstract = {User experience is now becoming central to our understanding of the usability of technology. Today many interactive tech-nology companies describe on their Web sites their commitment to experience-based design. There is also a trend in HCI communities to foreground experience-centered approaches to technology, a movement reflected in several recent arti-cles offering theoretical statements about the sensual and emotional conditions of interaction with technology. Thinking about Technology as Experience In a recent study we presented a basis for thinking about and evaluating technolo-gy as experience. We show how technol-ogy can be seen in terms of experience with technological artifacts. This approach orients us toward the felt-life of technology-toward engagement, en-chantment, irritation, and fulfillment. But we also recognize that the feeling-life does not begin and end with the immedi-ate quality of an experience, rather it extends across space and time to the sense we make of experience in terms of our selves, our culture, and our lives. To make these concepts usable, we have developed a framework for analyzing experience with technology [2].},

This is just as true for one person in a garage or a group of seasoned professionals in a Fortune 500 boardroom. What they have in common is a mission to penetrate that fog of uncertainty to discover a successful path to a sustainable business. The Lean Startup approach fosters companies that are both more capital efficient and that leverage human creativity more effectively. Inspired by lessons from lean manufacturing, it relies on “validated learning,” rapid scientific experimentation, as well as a number of counter-intuitive practices that shorten product development cycles, measure actual progress without resorting to vanity metrics, and learn what customers really want. It enables a company to shift directions with agility, altering plans inch by inch, minute by minute. Rather than wasting time creating elaborate business plans, The Lean Startup offers entrepreneurs - in companies of all sizes - a way to test their vision continuously, to adapt and adjust before it's too late. Ries provides a scientific approach to creating and managing successful startups in a age when companies need to innovate more than ever.},

In this paper, we outline a promising example of the co-production of research evidence between Fuse, the UKCRC Centre for Translational Research in Public Health and a local authority (LA) in north east England. Methods We critically examine attempts to share and use research findings to influence decision-making in a LA setting, drawing on insights from PH practitioners, managers, commissioners and academic partners involved in this organizational case study. We highlight what can be achieved as a co-located embedded researcher. Results The benefits and risks of ER are explored, alongside our reflections on the added value of this approach and the institutional prerequisites necessary for it to work. We argue that while this is not a new methodological approach, its application in PH as a way to facilitate evidence use is novel, and raises pragmatic and theoretical questions about the nature of impact and the extent to which it can be engineered. Conclusion With increased situated understanding of organizational culture and norms and greater awareness of the socio-political realities of PH, ER enables new co-produced solutions to become possible.},

abstract = {It is widely acknowledged that adopting a socio-technical approach to system development leads to systems that are more acceptable to end users and deliver better value to stakeholders. Despite this, such approaches are not widely practised. We analyse the reasons for this, highlighting some of the problems with the better known socio-technical design methods. Based on this analysis we propose a new pragmatic framework for socio-technical systems engineering (STSE) which builds on the (largely independent) research of groups investigating work design, information systems, computer-supported cooperative work, and cognitive systems engineering. STSE bridges the traditional gap between organisational change and system development using two main types of activity: sensitisation and awareness; and constructive engagement. From the framework, we identify an initial set of interdisciplinary research problems that address how to apply socio-technical approaches in a cost-effective way, and how to facilitate the integration of STSE with existing systems and software engineering approaches. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.

@article{friedman2006,
abstract = {Dewey's philosophy of religion, which admittedly does not occupy a great deal of his writing, represents a decisive move on his part beyond James. Many have pointed out that it was James who turned Dewey from Hegelianism to what becomes his instrumentalist rendition of Jamesian pragmatism.2 In this article, I will concentrate on what Dewey borrows (and changes) from James: a notion of experience meant to bridge the gap between traditional philosophical rationalism and empiricism (and meant to take the place of both), and an emphasis on meliorism. I agree with those who argue that Dewey “naturalizes” James.3 James's moral multiverse and his relatively uncritical approach to religious experience are replaced by a rather transparent religion of pluralism (or democracy) and a notion of moral faith which points from individual experience toward the pluralistic, democratic community. It would be more accurate to say that religion itself, any religious tradition, and religious experience, are replaced by the religious function in experience, through which the beliefs of the many and their aspirations form the working hypotheses of a progressive community. Faith in the existence of some religious Being is replaced by moral faith in the future, a faith which does not point to a divine Being beyond our own existences. James describes religious experience in psychological terms. Dewey wants to move beyond description. And he wants to move beyond the category of religious experience, beyond the idea that there is a special and unique type of experience which reflects a unique reality. For Dewey, the religious aspects of experience only point forward. In Dewey, James's pragmatism becomes instrumentalism. Where James may be satisfied to accept certain beliefs and experiences (including “special” beliefs and experiences) at face-value and to judge them by their consequences, Dewey demands a reconstruction of the meaning of a belief before he is willing to discuss its value; and value, for Dewey, involves the power to exert an influence at the level of community and address and redress social problems. 1},

Across social care, healthcare and public policy, enabled by the "big data" revolution (which has normalized large-scale data-based decision-making), there are moves to "join up" citizen databases to provide care workers with holistic views of families they support. In this context, questions of personal data privacy, security, access, control and (dis-)empowerment are critical considerations for system designers and policy makers alike. To explore the family perspective on this landscape of what we call Family Civic Data, we carried out ethnographic interviews with four North-East families. Our design-gamebased interviews were effective for engaging both adults and children to talk about the impact of this dry, technical topic on their lives. Our findings, delivered in the form of design guidelines, show support for dynamic consent: families would feel most empowered if involved in an ongoing co-operative relationship with state welfare and civic authorities through shared interaction with their data.},

This approach has been evaluated and validated using two distinct case studies involving 21 participants. In the first case study, we demonstrated the value of Sketching Dialogue as an additional supportive artefact for interactive discussion in the interview setting. The second case study involved a process of other researchers applying the method, within six different studies researching a range of topics. We outline how Sketching Dialogue provides a more effective form of engagement with participants, especially in respect of sensitive topics, or where emphatic engagement is required. Through this work, we demonstrate how the use of sketching can enhance the quality of traditional research interviews for HCI, in part due to its particularly flexible and accessible nature. Based on our experience, we also reflect upon the steps and practices needed to introduce a new qualitative research method to HCI researchers and interaction designers.},

The Turing Test should be replaced by the "Durkheim Test," that is systems should be tested with respect to their ability to meet community goals. Understanding community goals means analyzing the problem of due process in open systems. Due process means incorporating different viewpoints for decision-making in a fair and flexible manner. It is the analog of the frame problem in artificial intelligence. From analyses of organizational problem solving in scientific communities, the paper derives the concept of boundary objects, and suggests that this concept would be an appropriate data structure for distributed artificial intelligence. Boundary objects are those objects that are plastic enough to be adaptable across multiple viewpoints, yet maintain continuity of identity. Four types of boundary object are identified: repositories, ideal types, terrain with coincident boundaries, and forms.},

Interpretive flexibility, the structure of informatic and work process needs and arrangements, and, finally, the dynamic between illstructured and more tailored uses of the objects. Much of the use of the concept has concentrated on the aspect of interpretive flexibility and has often mistaken or conflated this flexibility with the process of tacking back-and-forth between the ill-structured and well-structured aspects of the arrangements. Boundary objects are not useful at just any level of scale or without full consideration of the entire model.

However, current commercial tools often do not effectively support patients and providers in collaboration surrounding these data. This paper examines patient expectations and current collaboration practices around patient-generated data. We survey 211 patients, interview 18 patients, and re-analyze a dataset of 21 provider interviews. We find that collaboration occurs in every stage of selftracking and that patients and providers create boundary negotiating artifacts to support the collaboration. Building upon current practices with patient-generated data, we use these theories of patient and provider collaboration to analyze misunderstandings and privacy concerns as well as identify opportunities to better support these collaborations. We reflect on the social nature of patient-provider collaboration to suggest future development of the stagebased model of personal informatics and the theory of boundary negotiating artifacts.},

In this paper, we argue that it offers an accessible and theoretically flexible approach to analysing qualitative data. We outline what thematic analysis is, locating it in relation to other qualitative analytic methods that search for themes or patterns, and in relation to different epistemological and ontological positions. We then provide clear guidelines to those wanting to start thematic analysis, or conduct it in a more deliberate and rigorous way, and consider potential pitfalls in conducting thematic analysis. Finally, we outline the disadvantages and advantages of thematic analysis. We conclude by advocating thematic analysis as a useful and flexible method for qualitative research in and beyond psychology. {\textcopyright} 2006 Edward Arnold (Publishers) Ltd.},

Data collection is constant and even insidious, with every click and every "like" stored somewhere for something. This book reminds us that data is anything but "raw," that we shouldn't think of data as a natural resource but as a cultural one that needs to be generated, protected, and interpreted. The book's essays describe eight episodes in the history of data from the predigital to the digital. Together they address such issues as the ways that different kinds of data and different domains of inquiry are mutually defining; how data are variously "cooked" in the processes of their collection and use; and conflicts over what can -- or can't -- be "reduced" to data. Contributors discuss the intellectual history of data as a concept; describe early financial modeling and some unusual sources for astronomical data; discover the prehistory of the database in newspaper clippings and index cards; and consider contemporary "dataveillance" of our online habits as well as the complexity of scientific data curation.

This article deconstructs the ideological grounds of datafication. Datafication is rooted in problematic ontological and epistemological claims. As part of a larger social media logic, it shows characteristics of a widespread secular belief. Dataism, as this conviction is called, is so successful because masses of people- naively or unwittingly-trust their personal information to corporate platforms. The notion of trust becomes more problematic because people's faith is extended to other public institutions (e.g. academic research and law enforcement) that handle their (meta)data. The interlocking of government, business, and academia in the adaptation of this ideology makes us want to look more critically at the entire ecosystem of connective media. {\textcopyright} The author(s), 2014.},

@article{johnson2010,
abstract = {Objective: To describe development and testing of a counseling tool intended to inform family planning clients while helping the family planning provider facilitate the client's decision-making process; and to discuss challenges and requisites for shifting to shared decision-making from the extremes of decision-making dominated by the provider, on one hand, or unaided by the provider, on the other. Development of the tool: The WHO Decision-Making Tool for Family Planning Clients and Providers is derived from evidence-based principles of client-centered care and counseling. This article discusses how these principles are manifested in the Tool and how the Tool aids both provider and client in improving counseling. Methods: Development of the Tool involved formative workshops with providers in Indonesia, Mexico, South Africa and Trinidad and Tobago and observational evaluation research in Indonesia, Mexico, and Nicaragua. Analysis of videotaped counseling sessions quantitatively assessed client-provider communication and decision-making. Also, focus-group discussions, interviews, and a questionnaire collected qualitative data from providers and clients. Results: In general, use of the Tool improved providers' counseling performance: they engaged clients more and gave more and better tailored information. For clients, the Tool increased their communication and involvement. Both the Nicaraguan and Mexican studies found marked shifts toward the client in the locus of decision-making after introduction of the Tool. Practice implications: Use of the tool improves the performance of both providers and clients in family planning counseling and decision-making. There are challenges, however, at the levels of both the provider and the organization in sustaining these changes and scaling up such initiatives in quality of care. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

Largely, we focus on defining strategies to build Digital Health Innovation Ecosystems in the context of developing countries, and pay particular attention to the challenges and potentials. Over a period of two years the conceptualisation was done by applying Design research as a methodology and the validation through two cycles of expert review feedback in order to improve the artifact. The conceptual digital health innovation ecosystem for South Africa portrays the inputs from research experts and practitioners in South Africa, Africa and Europe working in the Health domain. Feedback indicated that the conceptual digital health innovation ecosystem for South Africa is a good reflection of the realities of developing contexts where all role players and systems are indicated that affect digital health. This conceptualisation allows for the positioning of sub innovation ecosystems and related new products through applying an open innovation life cycle to improve the quality of life of ordinary citizens.},

abstract = {Ubiquitous computing systems tend to be complex, seamless, data-driven and interactive. Reacting to both context, and users' implicit actions resulting from the lived experience, they cast all traces of human life as potential 'data'. To augment users' endeavours, such systems are necessarily embedded below the line of human attention, drawing upon new and highly sensitive types of data. This begs the question, where is the moment of user consent and how can this moment be truly informed? We would argue that it is time to revisit our design principles in respect of consent and redress the balance of agency towards the user. We draw upon a series of multidisciplinary interviews with experts to (a) reframe consent for ubicomp, and (b) offer three indicative principles, supportive of consent, for designers to 'balance' against system functionality. We hope that this will afford a new prism through which designers might make value judgements. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2013 ACM.},

abstract = {With one million people treated every 36 hours, routinely collected UK National Health Service (NHS) health data has huge potential for medical research. Advances in data acquisition from electronic patient records (EPRs) means such data are increasingly digital and can be anonymised for research purposes. NHS England's care.data initiative recently sought to increase the amount and availability of such data. However, controversy and uncertainty following the care.data public awareness campaign led to a delay in rollout, indicating that the success of EPR data for medical research may be threatened by a loss of patient and public trust. The sharing of sensitive health care data can only be done through maintaining such trust in a constantly evolving ethicolegal and political landscape. We propose that a dynamic consent model, whereby patients can electronically control consent through time and receive information about the uses of their data, provides a transparent, flexible, and user-friendly means to maintain public trust. This could leverage the huge potential of the EPR for medical research and, ultimately, patient and societal benefit.},

Materials from an ethnography of computers are used to show how the design and production of a new entity (a new range of microcomputers) amounts to a process of configuring its user, where 'configuring' includes defining the identity of putative users, and setting constraints upon their likely future actions. Configuring occurs in a context where knowledge and expertise about users is socially distributed. As a result of this process, the new machine becomes its relationship with its configured users. In participants' determinations of the character of users, the new machine's case provides a powerful symbol of the boundary between insiders and outsides to the company.

This early warning electronic information system enables early reporting of children at risk to stimulate multidisciplinary collaboration among the different professionals involved with a particular child. We followed the introduction of the Child Index in practice. Our empirical analysis provides insight into the co-production of this ICT system and risk in child welfare practices. The analysis shows that the interaction between local and national, and disciplinary and organisational differences induces various constructions of risk, making the decision to signal and the act of signalling risk complex and the status of a signalled risk vague. Moreover, the analysis illustrates that the Child Index's goal of early signals for all children at risk does not fit professionals' daily practices and highlights the need to discuss whether the risk signalling ambitions of the Child Index are not a larger risk to children than the risks that are being targeted.},

annote = {Much of what is called big data in the commercial realm relies on forms of consent that make it difficult for people to understand the true nature of the risks to their privacy and difficult or impossible for them to opt out. Within the health-care sector there is a powerful drive to use patients' protected health data for the analytics on the business of health care, such as to improve hospital efficiency and health costs savings. There are real privacy risks to patients posed by these processes, while privileging benefits to stakeholders other than the patient, and no options being offered to opt out of such analytic uses of their information. Such decisions in the design of data solutions do more than fail to put the patients' interests first. They fundamentally shift the relationship of power and control between patients, their health-care providers, and the insurers around the questions of data. If the conversation in health technology innovation does not address the questions of data for whom, when, and why, then it will be a failure of social justice and an abuse of the trust that people have placed in the institutions of health care." people imagine data in very different ways. Understanding this key fact about data helps us understand why so-called ‘‘big data'' solutions to health care are so dif- ficult to implement in practice. Doctors, patients, and health- care entrepreneurs all value data in very different ways},

abstract = {The concept of Big Data has become very popular over the last decade, with large technology companies successfully building their business models around its exploitation. The public sector in the United Kingdom has tried to follow suit and local governments in particular have tried to introduce new models of service delivery based on the routine extraction of information from their own Big Data. These attempts have been hailed as the beginning of a new era for the public sector where service delivery and commissioning are shaped by data intelligence on local needs and by evidence on the outcomes. In this article we assess this claim and the extent to which it captures the way local governments in the United Kingdom use intelligence from Big Data in light of the structural barriers they face when trying to exploit their data. We also present a case study on the development and deployment of an integrated data model for children services in a large county council in the South-East of England.},

abstract = {Report of a thematic inspection to evaluate the effectiveness of the early help services for children and families provided by local authorities and their partners. The report draws on evidence from inspections in 12 local authorities, including the examination of 56 early help cases and the views of children and young people, parents, carers, practitioners and managers. It also considers 84 children's cases referred to local authorities. All of the local authorities visited had arrangements were in place to provide early help. The inspections found that: early help professionals had undertaken good assessments of children's needs in just under half of the cases; assessments that were of poor quality failed to sufficiently take into account children's individual circumstances; care plans often lacked clear objectives; plans were often not regularly reviewed; and that Local Safeguarding Children Boards (LSCBs) were not monitoring the effectiveness of early help. In relation to referrals from other agencies, some of these children were not directed to early help services from which they would have benefited. Recommendations include: the need for LSCBs to evaluate the quality and effectiveness of early help services; local authorities and partner agencies delivering early help should improvement in the quality and consistency of assessment and plans; and ensuring that children's needs for early help arising from parental substance misuse, mental ill health and domestic abuse are addressed in commissioning plans. It also highlights the need for local authorities to learn the lessons from recent serious case reviews.},
annote = {In just under half of the cases reviewed, early help professionals had undertaken sound assessments of children's needs. Over half, however, were of poor quality. In some instances, professionals gave limited or no consideration to family history. In other cases, they did not collect or analyse information about fathers or male partners, even when they were part of the child's household. Inspectors were particularly concerned that, in many cases, professionals failed to speak to the child and relied solely on what parents told them.


More generally, local authorities and their partners were not fully evaluating the impact of their early help work. The majority of their audits focused too much on process and compliance and not enough on the quality of the service and the extent to which it helped improve children's lives. Many partnerships had not yet developed systems to evaluate whether the right children were receiving early help at the right time.


Local authorities and partner agencies delivering early help to children and families should:  improve the quality and consistency of assessment and plans by:  promoting the use of evidence- and research-informed assessment practice  improving the quality of analysis in assessments  ensuring that assessments reflect the views and experience of the child and family  making the purpose clearer and improving the intended outcome  ensuring plans are regularly reviewed and that these reviews evaluate the child's and family's progress

Local authorities should: establish effective processes for evaluating the overall impact of early help.},

@techreport{copeland2015,
abstract = {The era of austerity has had a major impact on the UK's public finances. In few areas has this been felt more acutely than in the local government sector. Local authorities in England face a funding shortfall of {\pounds}12.4 billion by 2020. At the same time, councils provide 80% of all public services and demand for many of them is rising fast. {\pounds}10 billion of savings have already been made through cutting back on discretionary services and finding internal efficiencies, but the low-hanging fruit is almost gone. The sector therefore has a choice: either it must stop providing some services altogether or fundamentally reinvent the way it works. This report is about how it can achieve the latter by harnessing the principles of digital government: doing more and better with less, through smarter use of technology and data. To date, much of the debate on local digital government has been framed as a binary choice between localism and centralisation. The dominant narrative has been that the sector can have either local innovation and democracy, at the cost of duplication and inefficiency, or a Local Government Digital Service that dictates from the centre, saving money but disempowering local communities. That is a false choice. Instead, this report outlines a new vision for digital government. It entails putting in place the core building blocks on which digital reform depends: compatibility with open standards, a common data network, clear legal advice on data sharing, citizen control of personal data, interoperability of IT systems, a dynamic and flexible marketplace for online services, data analytics capabilities that cross public sector boundaries, budget flexibility and freedom to design local services to meet local needs. Offering eight key recommendations, the report outlines measures that could help the local government sector save in the region of {\pounds}10 billion by 2020.},

@article{kostkova2015,
abstract = {Today, everything is affected by the digital revolution – the impact of new technology on improv-ing the health and well-being of individuals, communities, and populations is unprecedented. Recent technological achievements have revolutionized clinical practice, from prevention through diagnosis, monitoring to disease management, and enabled unprecedented public interest and engagement in self-management and well-being. Digital health is defined as the " use of information and communications technologies to improve human health, healthcare services, and wellness for individuals and across populations. " Dozens of digital health projects have been conducted in Europe alone (1) and with the growth of mobile technology for improving health and well-being (mHealth). There is an unprecedented opportunity to transform the healthcare sector and empower citizens in taking charge of their own health (2). However, the successful development, integration and implementation of new technology and methods require a radical shift from traditional and single-disciplinary academic and clinical approaches. In order to truly embrace these opportunities and transform healthcare and improve well-being, we need a new approach to science and health research. Only when investigated together, aimed at solving real-world problems, will health and technology be in a position to create results with significant impact on the delivery of clinical and social care and improve the well-being of individuals and populations. First, recent technological advances enabled by the creation of real-time big data streams, social media, and infectious disease modeling are the focus of public health computer science, aiming to strengthen disease surveillance, early-warning, preparedness, and response through integration of traditional surveillance systems with new big data sources. Second, advances in reliability and accuracy of medical devices and personalized technology, together with booming wearable and tracking technology (MedTech), have rapidly become established as the mainstream enhancing opportunities for personalized care, improving self-management, and bringing the desirable out-come: behavior change. Third, with over 4.55 billion people worldwide using a mobile phone in 2014, mHealth apps and interventions empower users in the developed world and are accelerating unprecedented access to best evidence and healthcare service in the low and middle income settings. Fourth, more than a decade ago, Sir Muir Gray forecasted that " knowledge is the best enemy of disease – the application of what we know already will have a bigger impact on health and disease than any drug or technology likely to be introduced in the next decade " (3). Better use of technology for capturing, understanding, and disseminating knowledge is paramount for fulfilling this vision. The recent research achievements in web science, data mining and analytics, medical ontologies, and recommender systems provide further opportunities for better evidence dissemination, medical advice, and development of personalized persuasive intelligent systems. Fifth, serious games for health-and game-based learning have crossed the rubicon from entertainment technology to education and health interventions, and are getting firmly established as health educational and intervention tools. Finally, in light of the speed of data sharing technologies and the absence of a legal framework, we must engage in policy debates safeguarding individual privacy, regulation usage of data for commercial purposes, while enabling transparent data sharing for research. However, these challenges are only achievable through truly multi-disciplinary research collaborations. Frontiers in Public Health | www.frontiersin.org May 2015 | Volume 3 | Article 134 1 Kostkova Grand challenges in digital health Multidisciplinary Digital Health Intrinsically a multidisciplinary domain, digital health spans dis-ciplines including computer science, engineering, information science, journalism, economy, clinical medicine, public health, epidemiology, and others. Technology and computer science investigate new frameworks and algorithms of excellent theo-retical value, however, for successful digital health research. It is essential to address real-world medical challenges, solve clin-ical or public health problems, and recognize patients' needs. Similarly, clinical IT solutions should improve management of conditions and delivery of care through utilization of cutting edge computer science solutions. This gap needs to be bridged by a joint multidisciplinary collaboration between healthcare profes-sionals/medical scientists and computer scientists/engineers; so, both professions contribute to join research at equal levels. Thus, this Digital Health section, linked from Frontiers in Public Health and Frontiers in ICT, champions this approach by providing a unique interdisciplinary publication venue for both professional communities, enabling the cross-fertilization and breeding of the next generation of versatile researchers who truly appreciate the language, methods, needs, and challenges of other disciplines. This momentum is creating the need for interdisciplinary health and public health computer science training. Closer partnerships between research and industry/start-ups bringing on board policy makers are essential to drive a real change.},

abstract = {Information and communication technology (ICT) usage in contemporary child welfare practice reflects dominant managerial interests rather than those of the profession, and, importantly, of service users. Explicit use of ICT in the interests of service users remains embryonic, and professionals have been slow to capitalize on the communication potential of new technologies. This contrasts with technology uptake in other areas of human services. Unless this situation changes, client participation and power may decline further and managerial interests increasingly dominate. ICT has the potential to strengthen interaction between families and workers and change the conditions of initiation, distribution and use of spoken and written 'texts' in social work practice. This could significantly affect the ability of service users to be heard and to influence decision making. However, the opportunities and limitations of computer-mediated communication are a relatively new area of studytheir application to child welfare requires considerable care. Social workers should explore the advantages that ICT offers service users and challenge the digital divide which still affects significant pockets of service users, and reflect on our own role in this. Here, we ask why social work has been has been slow to capitalize on new approaches to its core business: communication.},

abstract = {It is obvious that our economic and social reality is currently guided by the ICT-based techno- economic paradigm. It is also clear that some countries, population groups, and persons that have adapted to changes more responsively have already obtained productivity gains, more sus- tainable employment patterns, and greater social cohesion. However, the issue of the digital divide has become a central issue in many countries. Estonia has enjoyed a very rapid information society development, but for achieving economic development and social cohesion, the issue of the digital divide needs to be addressed urgently. Among nonusers of the Internet in Estonia, there are two large groups—“Passive People” and “Blue Collars”—and the main barriers that lead to nonuse of the Internet are related to motiva- tion, skills, and access. If “Blue Collars” are not integrated into new employment structures, the ICT-based upgrade of many economic sectors will be impossible. As argued by the concept of techno- economic paradigms, however, such an attitude toward new technologies will only strengthen economic and social problems over time. Although the research and policy recom- mendations have been based on the Estonian case, it is reasonable to assume that the issues as well as the policy options in other transition and developing countries are quite similar. Namely, governments are obliged to change, reform, and readjust institutions and the environment and to demonstrate innovation in policy making to avoid the digital divide.},

abstract = {In this article, the concept of digital divide and its relation to social exclusion is analysed. After describing the several facets of the digital divide, the question is asked whether the divide is widening or narrowing? The definition of digital divide is reconsidered and the article argues that access to the technology alone is but a very rudimentary indicator of actually making use of digital opportunities. This is expanded in the section on risks arising from digital exclusion. Finally, implications of this approach of the digital divide for social work and social care are considered.},

Through three co-production engagements involving families receiving “early help” support from their local authority and support workers involved in supplying this care, we have identified existing data usage practices, explored the impact of those practices upon the supported families, and co-designed new and improved approaches - both technological and practice-based - that are perceived to offer families fairer treatment, greater influence, and to benefit from better decision-making. Our findings show that by applying Human-Data Interaction and giving supported families direct access to see and manipulate their own data, both during and outside of the support engagement, the locus of decision-making could be shifted towards the data subject.},

@article{ausloos2019,
abstract = {Data-driven research is rapidly becoming mainstream across different disciplines in academia and in investigative journalism. One of the key challenges researchers often struggle with is how to obtain good data. Whether one investigates political micro-targeting, discriminatory insurance practices, or physical exercise patterns across demographics, all require high-quality data. Obtaining the necessary data often depends on the goodwill of the entity in control of that data, frequently a private entity carefully guarding its data-assets. Researchers have tried to find ways round this through a range of technical tools (e.g. browser plugins, data scraping), with varying degrees of success. This paper purports to add an important legal tool to the catalogue of data-driven research methods: i.e. GDPR transparency measures, and data subject rights in particular. The reinforced data subject rights in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) have been lauded (and denounced) for their apparent potency. Especially the rights of access, portability and ‘explanation' are said to ensure important values such as autonomy, accountability and fairness. To make true on this promise, these rights can (should?) be used as a methodological tool for investigative research. Not just to scrutinize the data practices of those holding the data (e.g. uncovering discrimination), but also to enable broader research objectives (e.g. informing health policies). Indeed, these rights offer a legal hook to effectively crowdsource data-driven research. Against this backdrop, the paper will describe the merits, challenges, limitations and best practices of using data subject rights as a research method. It will do so by building on past experiences of some first initiatives in the EU and assessing how the growing number of ‘download my data' tools are useful/less. After an introductory section setting out some of the issues currently faced in data-driven research, the paper will explain how they might (not) be tackled by some of the key features of using GDPR transparency measures as a research method. The following section (4) is perhaps the core of the paper, describing the legal and practical operationalisation of these novel research methods, as well as the requirements for making them meaningful. The final section then takes a step back, positioning GDPR transparency measures within their broader (research methods and economic-technical) surroundings.},

Through this analysis, we explore the role of the fairness principle as introduced in Article 5(1)(a) and its multifaceted interpretation in the obligation to conduct a DPIA. Our paper argues that although there is a significant theoretical role for the considerations of fairness in the DPIA process, an analysis of the various guidance documents issued by data protection authorities on the obligation to conduct a DPIA reveals that they rarely mention the fairness principle in practice. Our analysis questions this omission, and assesses the capacity of fairness metrics to be truly operationalized within DPIAs. We conclude by exploring the practical effectiveness of DPIA with particular reference to (1) technical challenges that have an impact on the usefulness of DPIAs irrespective of a controller's willingness to actively engage in the process, (2) the context dependent nature of the fairness principle, and (3) the key role played by data controllers in the determination of what is fair.},

abstract = {According to different legal frameworks such as the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), an end-user's consent constitutes one of the well-known legal bases for personal data processing. However, research has indicated that the majority of end-users have difficulty making sense of what they are consenting to in the digital world. Moreover, it was demonstrated that marginalized people are confronted with even more difficulties dealing with their own digital privacy. In this paper, using an enactivist perspective in cognitive science, we develop a basic human-centric framework regarding digital consent. We argue the action of consenting is a sociocognitive action and includes cognitive, collective, and contextual aspects. Based on this theoretical framework, we present our qualitative evaluation of the practice of gaining consent conducted by the five big tech companies, i.e. Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple, and Microsoft (GAFAM). The evaluation shows that these companies are lacking in their efforts to empower end-users by considering the human-centric aspects of the action of consenting. We use this approach to argue that the consent gaining mechanisms violate principles of fairness, accountability and transparency and suggest that our approach might even raise doubts regarding the lawfulness of the acquired consent–particularly considering the basic requirements of lawful consent within the legal framework of the GDPR.},

The GDPR does not only cover how and what data should be saved by the service providers, but it also guarantees an easy way to know what data are collected and the freedom to export them. In this paper, we carry out a comprehensive study on the right to access data provided by Article 15 of the GDPR. We examined more than 300 data controllers, performing for each of them a request to access personal data. We found that almost each data controller has a slightly different procedure to fulfill the request and several ways to provide data back to the user, from a structured file like CSV to a screenshot of the monitor. We measure the time needed to complete the access data request and the completeness of the information provided. After this phase of data gathering, we analyze the authentication process followed by the data controllers to establish the identity of the requester. We find that 50.4% of the data controllers that handled the request, even if they store the data in compliance with the GDPR, have flaws in the procedure of identifying the users or in the phase of sending the data, exposing the users to new threats. With the undesired and surprising result that the GDPR, in its present deployment, has actually decreased the privacy of the users of web services.},

What this right concretely means, which types of tools companies have to provide to their customers and in which way, is currently uncertain because precedents from case law are missing. Contributing to closing this gap, we turn to the example of loyalty cards to supplement current implementations of the right to claim data with a user perspective. In our hands-on approach, we had 13 households request their personal data from their respective loyalty program. We investigate expectations of GDPR in general and the right to access in particular, observe the process of claiming and receiving, and discuss the provided data takeouts. One year after the GDPR has come into force, our findings highlight the consumer's expectations and knowledge of the GDPR and in particular the right to access to inform design of more usable privacy enhancing technologies.},

abstract = {For a decade HCI researchers and practitioners have been developing methods, practices and designs 'for the full range of human experience'. On the one hand, a variety of approaches to design, such as aesthetic, affective, and ludic that emphasize particular qualities and contexts of experience and particular approaches to intervening in interactive experience have become focal. On the other, a variety of approaches to understanding users and user experience, based on narrative, biography, and role-play have been developed and deployed. These developments can be viewed in terms of one of the seminal commitments of HCI, 'to know the user'. Empathy has been used as a defining characteristic of designer-user relationships when design is concerned with user experience. In this article, we use 'empathy' to help position some emerging design and user-experience methodologies in terms of dynamically shifting relationships between designers, users, and artefacts.

@article{woolgar2014,
abstract = {The paper explores the metaphor of machine as text, set within the context of longstanding problems in social theory about agency and object. These problems concern both the conventional basis of attribution of intentionality and presumptions about the boundedness of entities. In particular, our preconceptions about the nature and capacity of different entities shape what counts as legitimate accounts of action and behaviour. Materials from an ethnography of computers are used to show how the design and production of a new entity (a new range of microcomputers) amounts to a process of configuring its user, where 'configuring' includes defining the identity of putative users, and setting constraints upon their likely future actions. Configuring occurs in a context where knowledge and expertise about users is socially distributed. As a result of this process, the new machine becomes its relationship with its configured users. In participants' determinations of the character of users, the new machine's case provides a powerful symbol of the boundary between insiders and outsides to the company. An analysis of audio and video records of usability trials suggests the importance of boundary work in deciding the adequacy of the relationships between machine and user.},

abstract = {Europe's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has a fearsome reputation as “the law that can fine you €20 million.” But behind that scary slogan lies a text that can be a very helpful guide to designing data processing systems. This paper explores that side of the GDPR: how understanding it can produce more effective - and more trustworthy - systems. Three popular myths often take designers down the wrong track: that GDPR is about stopping processing, is about users, and is about consent. Instead we consider, from a design perspective, the GDPR's source material, its Principles, and its Lawful Bases for processing. Three examples - from the field of education, but widely applicable - show how “thinking with GDPR” has improved both the effectiveness and safety of large-scale data processing systems.},

abstract = {`Tracking' is the collection of data about an individual's activity across multiple distinct contexts and the retention, use, or sharing of data derived from that activity outside the context in which it occurred. This paper aims to introduce tracking on the web, smartphones, and the Internet of Things, to an audience with little or no previous knowledge. It covers these topics primarily from the perspective of computer science and human-computer interaction, but also includes relevant law and policy aspects. Rather than a systematic literature review, it aims to provide an over-arching narrative spanning this large research space. Section 1 introduces the concept of tracking. Section 2 provides a short history of the major developments of tracking on the web. Section 3 presents research covering the detection, measurement and analysis of web tracking technologies. Section 4 delves into the countermeasures against web tracking and mechanisms that have been proposed to allow users to control and limit tracking, as well as studies into end-user perspectives on tracking. Section 5 focuses on tracking on `smart' devices including smartphones and the internet of things. Section 6 covers emerging issues affecting the future of tracking across these different platforms.},

abstract = {Even after decades of intensive research and public debates, the topic of data privacy remains surrounded by confusion and misinformation. Many people still struggle to grasp the importance of privacy, which has far-reaching consequences for social norms, jurisprudence, and legislation. Discussions on personal data misuse often revolve around a few popular talking points, such as targeted advertising or government surveillance, leading to an overly narrow view of the problem. Literature in the field tends to focus on specific aspects, such as the privacy threats posed by 'big data', while overlooking many other possible harms. To help broaden the perspective, this paper proposes a novel classification of the ways in which personal data can be used against people, richly illustrated by real-world examples. Aside from offering a terminology to discuss the broad spectrum of personal data misuse in research and public discourse, our classification provides a foundation for consumer education and privacy impact assessments, helping to shed light on the risks involved with disclosing personal data.},

The work explores how the production and use of data is bound up with place, both in terms of physical and social geography. We detail three strands of the project. First, we consider how residents have sought to curate existing data about the street in the form of an archive with physical and digital components. Second, we report endeavours to capture data about the street's environment, especially of vehicle traffic. Third, we draw on the possibilities afforded by technologies for polling opinion. We reflect on how these engagements have: Materialised distinctive relations between the community and their data; surfaced flows and contours of data, and spatial, temporal and social boundaries; and enacted a multiplicity of 'small worlds'. We consider how such a conceptualisation of data-in-place is relevant to the design of technology.},

abstract = {Online food ordering platforms have changed how many of us purchase takeaway food. They have centralised and streamlined access, providing an opportunity for population-level dietary impact. However, they are currently not human-centred: typically providing limited functionality in support of users' values and dietary considerations; and focused on the provision of food that is broadly characterised as unhealthy. In this paper we explore a redesign of portions of Just Eat, an online takeaway food aggregator, building upon theoretical perspectives from public health. We conducted workshops in 2018 and 2019 to identify user behaviours and motivations then designed a human-centric web augmentation template that could disrupt platform provider behaviours and increase functionality to support users' desires and well-being. We provide a template for lightweight end-user appropriations of food ordering platforms that would enable researchers to explore how health information features could improve individual health and satisfaction, and design guidance for disruptively augmenting existing food ordering platforms (or designing new ones) to enable transparency, personalisation, and self-monitoring to empower users and improve their well-being.},

abstract = {Abstract  As users of computer networks have become more active in producing their own electronic records, in the form of transcripts of onlinediscussions, ethicists have attempted to interpret this new situation interms of earlier models of personal data protection. But thistransference results in unprecedented problems for researchers. Thispaper examines some of the central dichotomies and paradoxes in thedebate on research ethics online in the context of the concrete study ofa virtual community that we carried out. We argue that alienation, notprivacy, is the actual core of the ethical problems of virtual communityresearch. While practically everybody is allowed and often welcome tojoin online communities (which undermines the claim to privacy), mostparticipants would agree that members and visitors are not authorized touse, or `harvest,' or sell the product of the group communication. To dothat, they would be expected to ask for permission preferably before thecontent has been produced, thus granting participants' right to controltheir own product. This `non-alienation principle' should be the basisof emergent social conventions in cyberspace. It would apply toresearchers as to anyone else. With certain types of research, wesuggest, cyberspace provides unique opportunities for empoweringsubjects by involving them as contributors in the research project.},
annote = {access is not the same as involvement

This one is interesting - at first glance it might not seem relevant because it is about how researchers engage with online communities, but actually there are some relevant points.
Consider that researcher - research subject is also a service interaction. Researchers want to use subjects' data - e.g. in this case the conversations and public posts of members of internet communities.},

abstract = {In the commodification of consent, a legal concept designed to empower users has been transformed into an asset that can be traded across firms. Users interact with a consent dialog offered by one coalition member. The default setting allows any other coalition member, including both publishers and third-party vendors, to use this consent as a legal basis for processing personal data. In doing so, the commodification of consent creates interdependent privacy considerations within the notice and consent paradigm. This paper considers how this legal innovation could change the distribution of revenues among firms. Our model shows coalitions create the most value for firms with large consent deficits, which describes the proportion of users who the firm does not directly obtain consent from. The market leader in consent can capture all of the coalition fees by forming a series of 2-firm coalitions. Finally, a model extension shows how consent coalitions shift users towards providing consent to the coalition against the users' wishes even though the probability of erroneously providing consent in a given dialog remains unchanged.},

A second set of lenses, which includes the rational, pluralist, interpretive, and radical perspectives (Bradshaw-Camball and Murray 1991), is used to focus on researchers' views of the role of power and different IT outcomes. We apply each lens separately to describe patterns emerging from the previous power and IT studies. In addition, we discuss the similarities and differences that occur when the two sets of lenses are simultaneously applied. We draw from this discussion to develop metaconjectures, (i.e., propositions that can be interpreted from multiple perspectives), and to suggest guidelines for studying power in future research.},

To better understand what empowerment means in our community, we reviewed 54 CHI full papers using the terms empower and empowerment. Based on our analysis and informed by prior writings on power and empowerment, we construct a framework that serves as a lens to analyze notions of empowerment in current HCI research. Finally, we discuss the implications of these notions of empowerment on approaches to technology design and offer recommendations for future work. With this analysis, we hope to add structure and terminological clarity to this growing and important facet of HCI research.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the phenomenon of emotional attachments to mobile phones. We introduce the term "mobile attachment" and define it as a bond between a person's self and a mobile phone that varies in strength. Based on a critical reflection of interdisciplinary literature, a conceptual mobile attachment model is developed. Within this model causes, consequences, and influencing factors of mobile attachment are exposed and elaborated. We argue that mobile attachment emerges when the mobile phone becomes part of the user's self concept. The link between the user and their mobile phone may be fostered when it empowers, enriches, or gratifies the user's self. Attachment causes lead to "design space determinants" that enable user experience designers to design for mobile attachment. Attachment consequences may be operationalized for user experience evaluation.},

abstract = {The debate about how to govern personal data has intensified in recent years. The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, which came into effect in May 2018, relies on transparency mechanisms codified through obligations for organisations and citizen rights. While some of these rights have existed for decades, their effectiveness is rarely tested in practice. This paper reports on the exercise of the so-called right of access, which gives citizens the right to get access to their personal data. We study this by working with participants—citizens for whom the law is written—who collectively sent over a hundred data access requests and shared the responses with us. We analyse the replies to the access requests, as well as the participant's evaluation of them. We find that non-compliance with the law's obligations is widespread. Participants were critical of many responses, though they also reported a large variation in quality. They did not find them effective for getting transparency into the processing of their own personal data. We did find a way forward emerging from their responses, namely by looking at the requests as a collective endeavour, rather than an individual one. Comparing the responses to similar access requests creates a context to judge the quality of a reply and the lawfulness of the data practices it reveals. Moreover, collective use of the right of access can help shift the power imbalance between individual citizens and organisations in favour of the citizen, which may incentivise organisations to deal with data in a more transparent way.},

abstract = {In this paper, I articulate a critique of design as conjuring (design as design) and I argue that it is incompatible with the idea of user empowerment. In particular, I discuss the idea of empowerment-in-use and I highlight the role of design seams and scars in supporting it through appropriation and design-after-design. To support this argument, I draw on some recent contributions in Participatory Design (PD), Human Computer Interaction (HCI), New Media Studies, and Science and Technology Studies (STS), and I discuss three illustrative case studies from the area of digital Do-it-Yourself (DIY). I argue that restoring the sign in design through design seams and scars can be a way to explore different forms and perhaps deeper levels of critical engagement and participation supporting empowerment.},

   abstract = {The Future We Deserve is a collection of 100 essays from people of all walks of life discussing our world from amazingly different perspectives. Utopia or oblivion, plenty or famine, freedom or slavery? We do not know, but we do know that there is a vital thread of insight which emerges when people think together about what they really want, what matters most to them, and how we are all going to live in just a few years. In The Future We Deserve, authors pick a single facet of the future, and discuss something close, personal and real to them. There's little time to extrapolate in 500 words, pieces are short, direct and powerful. What emerges from this practice is an immediate and visceral sense of the immensity of the forces which shape the future, and the diversity and complexity of the possibilities. Each potential future discussed is an island, and whether they are compatible with each-other in some wider scenario is not the point: rather, each possible, plausible future stakes out a new piece of the terrain. All of this could happen. An amazingly dense read, The Future We Deserve will stay with you long, long after you read it. The authors regularly discuss the pieces in the book, and are still learning from each-other, and expanding their understanding.},

We explore how contextual, behavioral and experiential data can be used as design material for remote insight collection and remote design intervention. The first " contextual " iteration sets out to understand the design context with its complexities, based on a combination of quantitative sensor data and qualitative interview sessions. The second 'informed' iteration utilizes design probes, remotely connected to a data-canvas, to explore behavioral, experiential and contextual consequences of design interventions. The dynamic and open character of the introduced data-canvas allowed us to iterate quickly without requiring physical presence of the designer. Finally, we translate the findings from this case study into a two step model for data-enabled design that we further discuss to outline what next steps are required towards constructing a framework for data enabled design.},

Provenance helps us to understand the evolution and relationships of files; how and when different versions of a document were created, or how different documents in a collection build on each other through copy-paste events. Though methods for tracking provenance and the subsequent use of this meta-data have been proposed and developed into tools, there have been no studies documenting the types and frequency of provenance events in typical computer use. This is knowledge essential for the design of efficient query methods and information displays. We conducted a longitudinal study of knowledge workers at Intel Corporation tracking provenance events in their computer use. We also interviewed knowledge workers to determine the effectiveness of provenance cues for document recall. Our data shows that provenance relationships are common, and provenance cues aid recall.},
