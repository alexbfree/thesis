Data-Centrism

### What is Data?

Data is an oft-used word that carries multiple meanings. In everyday speech, it might refer to mobile phone bandwidth, a filled application form or a collection of files. Even experts have a variety of definitions of data, as well as the related concepts of information and knowledge[@zim2015]. In this study, we refer to data by its accepted definition as information or knowledge stored in a form suitable for computer processing. Wellisch expressed this as 'the representation of concepts or other entities, fixed in or on a medium in a form suitable for communication, interpretation, or processing by human beings or by automated systems'[@wellisch1996], which is a useful definition as it includes the fact that both humans and algorithms can use data, and that data is something that needs interpretation.

From a strict grammatical stance, 'data' is a plural of the singular 'datum' thus it is more correct to write 'the data are correct' - but this usage is rapidly declining from use[@grammaristData] and throughout this thesis I use the more widely adopted usage of treating data as a singular mass noun, as in 'the data is correct'.

The concepts of 'data' and 'information' are closely related, so much so that they are often used interchangeably. Ackoff presented a model for distinguishing data, information, knowledge, understanding/intelligence and wisdom, in which he describes data as the physical symbols, effectively the 1's and 0's stored in a computer or the ink marks on a page, which becomes useful when humans or algorithms are able to deduce facts from those symbols to answer simple questions - at this point it becomes 'information'. Being able to interpret deeper how and why questions allow information to become knowledge and understanding, towards the ultimate goal of wisdom[@ackoff1989]. This is often represented as the DIKW pyramid (DIKW being shorthand for the data-information-knowledge-wisdom transformation that occurs as you move up through the layers), the origin of which is unknown[@wallace2007]. Figure 1 builds upon a representation by George Pór[@por1997] of the pyramid as a 'wisdom curve', showing how increasing meaning and value can be obtained from data as deeper questions can be asked of it. This theme of obtaining meaning and value from data is an important aspect of my research that I will refer back to.

This model that turning data into information can be thought of as using that data to answer questions is consistent with the idea that "information can be thought of as the resolution of uncertainty"[@wikipediaInformation]. The exact origin of this definition is unknown but it is often attributed to mathematician Claude Shannon[@shannon1948]. Indeed from an etymological stance, one who is informed is one who has received knowledge or concepts as a result of what has been communicated to them. Thus we can consider that data is the material from which that information can be received. It follows also that data contains uncertainty that must be resolved in order for it to become meaningful information.

### The Rise of Data-centrism

The earliest computer systems used data to store mathemical and scientific facts. Data processing allowed for previously manual operations to be performed with greater speed and accuracy, most famously the work of Alan Turing and the case of the Enigma code breakers during World War II[@hutton2012]. This work was the advent of general-purpose computing - machines that could be applied to any problem provided you could reduce that problem to data. Businesses over the following decades began to apply computers to myriad new problem areas in all different fields of work and life, and doing so began the encoding of information about people as data, be it for statistical purposes like censuses or research, or simply to enable the more efficient serving of customers by storing databases of customer records.

The personal computer revolution[@britannicaPCrevolution] of the late 1970s and 1980s put computers in every office and eventually every home too, and it soon became commonplace that each individual would have data stored about them in companies' databases. In the subsequent years three factors have combined to accelerate this trend of storing data about people: i) labour costs have remained high and companies have sought ways to automate their businesses and to implement online services and call centres in place of in-person staff interaction, ii) computer processing and storage has become ever cheaper thanks to the advent of cloud computing, meaning that many business processes could be reduced to data processing tasks or entire businesses be moved online, and iii) the rise of smartphones and web-enabled devices have meant that the public are now ready and willing to conduct much of their daily business online through the web and apps. These factors have encouraged both commercial and civic providers to centralise their services and to 'go digital' to the greatest degree possible. In doing so they collect ever more data about people (now 'service users' or just 'users'). Data is now seen as a resource which can be mined for value, and harnessed for profit and business efficiency - 'the new oil'[@toonders2014]. Zuboff, in her 2019 book on 'surveillance capitalism', characterises this new digital world as the collection of human behaviour data so that it can be used as free raw material and converted into profit through hyper-personalised advertising and targeting by software platforms[@zuboff2019]. This philosophy is also known as 'data-ism'[@brooks2013].

As a result of data-ism, the collection of data about people has become an inevitable part of modern life. We live 'digital lives'[@ted2018] where we each interact directly and indirectly with hundreds of digital systems every day - as you shop, socialise, or browse online; as you listen to music or watch TV; as you interact with governments or healthcare services; as you travel, and many more. Every one of those interactions indicates the presence of data about you stored in a company database. Every aspect of our lives involves the input, processing and output of data – either provided by, collected from, or generated about, us. And the digital data we create and consume (whether consciously or not  - data sharing is often unwitting[@tolmie2018]) has a direct influence on our lived experience - from decisions about what we are entitled to and what opportunities we will be offered, to the advertisements and content recommendations we are shown while we browse.

Unfortunately, the large-scale systems which collect data about us now function as 'data traps'[@abiteboul2015] - where data about us is easily gathered but very hard to remove or even to access. This creates a lack of agency for the individuals living in this data-centric world. The World Economic Forum's "Rethinking Personal Data" project recognised the critical role that data - specifically personal data - data created by and about people - now holds, and identified that 'an asymmetry of power exists today [...] created by an imbalance in the amount of information about individuals held by industry and governments, and the lack of knowledge and ability of the same individuals to control the use of that information'[@WEF2011;@WEF2013;@WEF2014context;@WEF2014lens].
