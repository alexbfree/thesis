[Then 7.4(#7.4, using a ToC framing, my identified _opportunities for progress_ are introduced, divided into _four different trajectories of change_ that could be executed in practice to pursue better HDR.]

![Figure X: ToC chart showing Trajectories of Change for improving Human Data Relations](./src/figs/figX-change-trajectories.jpg)

Now, having established some of the key obstacles to improving HDR, we can move to considering what opportunities exist to pursue the HDR wants and to overcome those obstacles. This section will first introduce a framing for those opportunities, and then illustrate specific opportunities in detail.

In Figure X, the ToC frame introduced above in 7.1.3 / Figure 29 is used as a canvas upon which to position the different trajectories for changes that could improve HDR. By enumerating the possible types of activity that can bring about change, each of the four quadrants's core change trajectory can be named, as shown in purple, forming the backbone of the roadmap for improving HDR, which can be summarised thus:

- _**Learn & Discover**_ (CI): In this quadrant, individuals, researchers, activists and other stakeholders work in groups to understand data attitudes and user needs, and to gain collective knowledge of data collection and usage practices which are sometimes hidden.
- _**Defend & Create**_ (CE): In this quadrant, activists work to ensure current HDR capabilities are not eroded, while researchers, designers, technologists and social innovators design and create new technologies, operating models, organisations and interface designs, the structures enabling a world with better HDR.
- _**Influence & Motivate**_ (IE): In this quadrant, individuals' relationships with data and with data holders, as well as data holders and policymakers' relationships, can improved. For us, as external actors seeking change, the task is to influence the many parties by showcasing and facilitating newly created structures and capabilities, and to harness our new collective knowledge to advocate the benefits of changing data-related behaviours.
- _**Educate & Empower**_ (II): In this quadrant, individuals ways of thinking about data and data holders grow and evolve towards a state we could call 'feeling empowered'. This change is driven through education, improving Human Data Relations literacy, and through the experience of new capabilities and changed relationships with data and with data holders that can empower individuals to hold a more aware and equitable position in those relationships and in their digital life.

[TODO: do we need a summary diagram here?]
[Figure X: SUMMARY OF OPPORTUNITIES]

### Learn & Discover

Research such as that conducted in this PhD is an example of the collective, internal focused activity that can be done in this quadrant to further the goals of better HDR: Groups of people working together using a variety of techniques such as participatory co-design, interview-based quantititative studies, design prototype evaluation and other HCI techniques can gain new understandings of individual needs and experiences in HDR. However rather than mapping out such possibilities, this section will focus on more novel approaches that go beyond traditional HCI research towards activities that are potentially more socially impactful.

#### Opportunity 1: Auditing Data Holders
Helps with: Ecosystem transparency

Through the emergence of new tracking tools such as TrackerControl and Apple's App Activity Reports, individuals can observe the actual behaviour of the apps they use, providing a new means to identify potential data sharing destinations, to assess whether providers are meeting their promises, and to uncover new questions that can be asked of providers using data access rights. By collectively examining and comparing such data, it is possible to begin to map out the data ecosystem, as was done in the digipower investigation [REF].

#### Opportunity 2: Collective Investigation
Helps with: Ecosystem transparency

This sort of combination of individual observations is just one of many ways in which individuals can, through working together, discover more information about data usages and practices. Collectives offer a powerful means to examine how providers categorise users and process their data, for example by comparing field values to understand the range of possible values or inferences a data holder might have stored, or by comparing variations in information presentations, data rights handling or customer service experiences to reverse engineer provider practices.

#### Opportunity 3: A 'Data Understanding' Industry
Helps with: Data Understanding, Ecosystem Transparency

Given the complexity of today's digital landscape and the forces that hinder better HDR, there is scope for an industry to develop around 'data understanding' services. This can encompass everything from self-service tools people can use to gain insights over their data (such as those provided by Ethi or Hestia.ai), to workshops helping consumer organisations, journalists, regulators, lawyers and other interested parties to collectively gain understanding and value from data so that they might better achieve their goals, as well as serving a general educational purpose for example in schools. This industry is beginning to emerge, but faces challenges in funding, scalability, governance, and credibility and should be supported (REF Pidoux et al).

### Defending the Status Quo and Pushing for Compliance

Given the shifting power balance of the information landscape outlined in 7.3.4.1, 7.3.4.2 and 7.3.4.4, it is clear that there is an opportunity, perhaps a need, for HDR reformers to carry out activities that monitor and publicise any changes that providers make that reduce individuals' HDR capabilities. Having identified such changes it is then easier for those HDR reformers, and indeed the wider public, to fight to protect and maintain current capabilities, as we see in the Right to Repair movement [REF] or the Net Neutrality movement [REF].
[mention also the idea of pushing to make sure what should be done, is done - e.g. in GDPR returns]

#### Opportunity 4: Tapping the Seams in pursuit of a Free Information Landscape

Compounding the impacts of reducing agency described in 7.3.4.4 is the 'dumbing down' of technology. Apple, for example, encourages users to consider technology as 'magical', rather than as understandable tools to be harnessed and understood; Such thinking is manifested in their hardware design too: phones that cannot be opened up, expanded or repaired [REF]; the removal of accessory ports, disk drives, and headphone jacks [REF]; increased controls over what can be installed on users' hard drives and which areas of disk can be modified [REF]. These changes simplify the technology and bring it to a more mainstream audience, something that the iPhone and iPad must be given due credit for - but it happens at the cost of reducing user agency. Companies like Apple increasingly encourage users to think of technology as a black box, which you cannot and should not look inside.

![Figure X: The 'Black Box' view that many modern technology providers present](./src/figs/figX-black-box.png)

[TODO rephrase this para as a better introduction to Seams]
An important concept to understand in this space is that of **_seams_**. In 'The Politics of Seams' Storni outlines that current designs are incompatible with empowerment-in-use, and highlights the role of design seams (and their removal) as being a key determiner of user power [REF]. He says that the designer passes some power to the user through their design, but also, that users should be able to take some power on their own terms (repurposing etc). He talks [says what] about the problems of technology as magic/design as conjuring:

> _"Magical design prioritises pleasing and surprising a passive user who can only use the solution as authorised"_ -- Cristiano Storni [@storni2014]

Therefore part of what we need to be doing is (a) highlight and (b) removing seams/creating new seams between disconnected parts....

Groups of HDR reformers can combine development skills, innovation and disruptive design approaches to find and publicise new ways to circumvent providers' efforts to control and limit their users' agency, as illustrated by the use of web scrapers and web augmentation approaches to try and obtain information or functionality from providers that would otherwise be inaccessible.
[also mention device tenancy (zeynep) and firefox containers/taking back power in the browser/browser as seam (reference Goffe et al)]

#### Opportunity 5: Collective Activism

Collectives can also exert external influence in the adjacent 'Defend & Create' quadrant by using their learnings through data to demand change, as seen in the case of Uber drivers working together to obtain data on algorithmic judgements that affect their work and using that as evidence to help them demand fairer working conditions [REF].
[individuals collectively pressuring to improve GDPR responses, drive data portal improvements, etc]
[traditional means e.g. press, public campaigns but also new ways e.g. mass GDPR or targeted GDPR]
[mention dehaye's pressure, leading to FB Off Site Activity, my success with Spotify - compare also to Bookbeat?]
[noyb as example, also Privacy International, Bits of Freedom,]

[mention pooldata, data unions]

### Create New Structures and Systems

#### Opportunity 6: A central home for your personal data
Helps with: Data Understanding, Data Useability, Ecosystem Transparency, General Human Challenges
Affected by: Lack of interoperability (7.3.6.1/12)

![Figure X: A conceptual model for a Personal Data Store system that I developed for the BBC Cornmarket project](./src/figs/figX-conceptual-PDS.png)

As others have identified, one of the most promising models for giving people a new and improved relationship with their data is to create a place where one's personal data can be stored and aggregated in one place, a personal data locker (see 2.3.4). This prospect was explored through the BBC R&D Cornmarket project during my internship, as detailed in 3.4.3.3 [OR MOVE SOME OF THAT TEXT HERE]. As alluded to in the quote opening Chapter 1, people's data is scattered (see also 2.2.4 and [@abiteboul2015]), and simply providing the ability to bring data from sources together in one place can improve people's understanding of their data and its ecosystem. This integration requires technical standardisation but also

talk about the capacity to unify

[add quote from BBC research where people liked the concept of a place for your data]

#### Opportunity 7: Modelling Data as Life Information
Helps with: Life Information as Material, Limited machine understanding of data

As part of the BBC R&D Cornmarket project, I carried extensive information modelling and design work with colleagues on how today's common types of data might be modelled as life information in order to help with the stated goals.

First we need to consider what a piece of data is, which is different from what data format it is or what semantic concept it represents.

![Figure X: High Level Data Types](./src/figs/figX-data-types.jpg)

It is possible to use some abstraction of commonalities to group together pieces of data that can perform a similar role:

![Figure X: Happenings](./src/figs/figX-happenings.jpg)

It can also be useful to model the different attributes of data in terms of what can be done to it.

![Figure X: Attributes of Data](./src/figs/figX-data-attributes.jpg)

We can imagine a simplified model of presenting information to users:

![Figure X: Simple Life Information Presentation Model](./src/figs/figX-simple-data-model.jpg)

#### Opportunity 8: Algorithmic Meaning Extraction and Learning Systems
Helps with: engagement/efforts

Key idea to share: that the system should try and automatically associate data to entities.
also: calendar/contact as start point. conjecture and assertion to reduce effort. learning, correcting, like an assistant [ref]
world2vec as an exmample of the sophistication of what is being done and harnessed for provider purposes[REF]

![Figure X: A design for Facebook's world2vec model, semantically modelling data from social media posts on Facebook](./src/figs/figX-facebook-world2vec.png)

[citation: diagram by Alex Peysakhovic, from CS 4803 / 7643: Deep Learning Guest Lecture: Embeddings and world2vec, a guest lecture at Georgia Tech by Facebook AI research engineer Ledell Wu, given Feb 18th 2020. https://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2020/cs7643_spring/slides/L13_Embedding_world2vec_final_vers ion.pdf , archived at https://web.archive.org/web/20211018015836/https://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2020/cs7643_spri ng/slides/L13_Embedding_world2vec_final_version.pdf]

one possible flow of how to identify data

![Figure X: Determining the nature of a piece of data](./src/figs/figX-determining-nature-of-data.jpg)

show how attributes types etc (ref back to earlier diagrams) can be detected:

![Figure X: Identifying the attributes of data](./src/figs/figX-interpreting-data-as-information.jpg)

show how different types of entity can be identified. important to establish associations.

### Create New Information Interfaces

#### Opportunity 8: Life Information interfaces

![Figure X: Life Partitioning](./src/figs/figX-rooms-of-life.jpg)
(add credit for cluedo board)

Life partitioning would allow conceptually the user to navigate information according to what semantic concepts it is or relates to.

(to do: make this fit on a portrait page)

#### Opportunity 9: Ecosystem Detection & Visualisation

Key idea: detecting the ecosystem. Example: the subscription detector.

![Figure X: Subscrab: An example application for ecosystem detection and visualisation](./src/figs/figX-subscrab.png)

#### Opportunity 10: Inclusive Information Flows

Key idea: Rivers of flowing info. Including people.

### Create New Capabilities

#### Opportunity 11: Exploratory Actions & Asking Tools

It is important to think about the capabilities people will have
(expand on and map this back to all the PIM calls in 2.2.2)

refer back to dashboard mockup & data needs to be interrogable and malleable. What if there aren't visualisations for your questions. But also, visualisations raise questions

Here are a series of data cards we used in a user research activity at BBC. (initially conceived by me, condensed and reworked by myself in collaboration with Chris Gameson)

![Figure X: Data actions](./src/figs/figX-data-actions.jpg)

![Figure X: Data questions](./src/figs/figX-data-questions.jpg)

Key idea: verbs. types of question. asking tools not just predetermined insights.

#### Opportunity 12: Self Profiling & Curating your Digital Self

Key idea: self profiling (a la BBC) but also more generally, the "I want a bicycle" VRM idea (unless already covered)

### Influence & Motivate

#### Opportunity 13: Regulating the Information Landscape

Key point: regulation of *landscape* -> new moves DSA
maybe also some ref back to end C5 and to the GDPR Guidelines

#### Opportunity 14: Information Unification and Schematisation

Key idea: generalised types of data (refer back to relevant model above)
[reference to Solid Shapes etc]

#### Opportunity 15: Life/Ecosystem Information as Boundary Objects (Multi-stakeholder Design)
[POSSIBLY CUT THIS ONE]

Key idea: Data as bringing different people together , ref living lab. also use of cards in my research and at BBC (and ref Urquhart?)

#### Opportunity 16: The Business Value of Transparency and Human Centricity

key idea: tackling resistance reducing liability, improved consent . less waste cost on broadcast advertising (could express it as a development of all the ad personalisation today). selling the benefits.

### Educate & Empower

#### Opportunity 17: Life Information & Personal Data Ecosystem Literacy

Key point: define it, distinguish it from technical skills/literacy as well as from numbercrunching Literacy

#### Opportunity 18: Individual Discovery: Mapping Your Personal Data Ecosystem

Key point: empowering individuals as investigators. Can help them with tools or learning programs.
