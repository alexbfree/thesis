CUT FROM CHAPTER 2


In effect, Chapter 7 expands upon the primary empirical research question to ask a broader, more practical question: _"What relationship do people need with their personal data, and how could that be achieved?"_

Research Gap: Defining the Research Agenda for Achieving Human-centricity in Practice

last part of RQ that I dropped:

, and how could that be achieved


THIS IS THE PART THAT EXPLAINS THE ROUTE BEYOND THE EMPIRICAL.
MOVE TO CHAPTER 3 OR 7?

By adopting both a participatory design and technical strategist's standpoint, building on the theoretical foundations of effective data access, information management and human-centric data interaction, this thesis progresses PDE / MyData thinking, using methods detailed in the next chapter, in pursuit of my

I will seek to synthesise an understanding of the technical, legal, policy, economic and social realities of the PDE landscape itself, sufficient to inform the design of PDE processes and systems. Thinking of the barriers cascade in the SI space [@li2010], what barriers exist that inhibit the building or adoption of PDE human-centric technologies? What opportunities might make it easier to overcome these barriers and to catalyse progress toward the human-centric agenda as envisioned in the MyData declaration? What are the key challenges faced when we attempt to build human-centric technologies in today's world? By applying learnings about human experiences and attitudes to the data-centric world to the practice of PDE design & development, can we more clearly map the road ahead and define a research agenda for the next step of tackling the PDE challenge?
