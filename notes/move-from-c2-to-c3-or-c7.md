CUT FROM CHAPTER 2


In effect, Chapter 7 expands upon the primary empirical research question to ask a broader, more practical question: _"What relationship do people need with their personal data, and how could that be achieved?"_

Research Gap: Defining the Research Agenda for Achieving Human-centricity in Practice

last part of RQ that I dropped:

, and how could that be achieved


THIS IS THE PART THAT EXPLAINS THE ROUTE BEYOND THE EMPIRICAL.
MOVE TO CHAPTER 3 OR 7?

By adopting both a participatory design and technical strategist's standpoint, building on the theoretical foundations of effective data access, information management and human-centric data interaction, this thesis progresses PDE / MyData thinking, using methods detailed in the next chapter, in pursuit of my

I will seek to synthesise an understanding of the technical, legal, policy, economic and social realities of the PDE landscape itself, sufficient to inform the design of PDE processes and systems. Thinking of the barriers cascade in the SI space [@li2010], what barriers exist that inhibit the building or adoption of PDE human-centric technologies? What opportunities might make it easier to overcome these barriers and to catalyse progress toward the human-centric agenda as envisioned in the MyData declaration? What are the key challenges faced when we attempt to build human-centric technologies in today's world? By applying learnings about human experiences and attitudes to the data-centric world to the practice of PDE design & development, can we more clearly map the road ahead and define a research agenda for the next step of tackling the PDE challenge?

From C3, about the peripheral activities


As well as analysing participant data, an important aspect of pursuing answers to the three research questions was to develop theories, models and ideas and then to iteratively develop those models over time. This was particularly important in my BBC placement [TODO and Hestia, need to update this paragraph], which was the place where theoretical knowledge acquired from the first two case studies collided with practical reality. As part of this process, I produced many different models of personal data and of personal data interaction. In some cases I was able to test these by discussing them with expert colleagues at the BBC; in other cases by disseminating ideas through blogs, tweets, workshop papers and lectures, a process which helps to refine and clarify ideas but also stimulate valuable discussions with interested people to gain feedback that helps develop the models further. Figure 19 shows an example of a model I was developing for unifying personal data in the PDS context while embedded at BBC R&D [TODO and Hestia].
