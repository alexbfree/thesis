## Old Snippets


- other methodological research approaches I am building upon:
  - Boundary Objects [Star]
  - "Things to think with" [Brandt & Messeter]
  - Participatory co-design
  - Home visits [Mannay]


Our work is motivated by a digital civics agenda (Vines et al., 2013) - involving people in design so that their expertise can be used to shape design thinking, using boundary objects to allow different parties to connect and share experiences and expertise, and seeking to inspire societal change by allowing those in power to better empathise with the points of view of the citizens they serve. Another key element of our stance is a focus on improving the human relationships (in our case between support worker and supported families) so that citizens may be better empowered in their relations with the state (Vlachokyriakos et al., 2016).

###Â Old longform of trajectories of change (C7)

Table: Table 16. **Trajectories of change for improving Human Data Relations**.

|Change Trajectory|Quadrant|Explanation|
|:------------|-|:-------------------------------------------------------|
|1. Participatory Research|CI[^17]|Through groups of people working together (either researchers working with individuals (as in Case Study Two), or representatives of different groups coming together (as in the family/staff co-design workshops of Case Study One)) new understandings can be gained of the impacts of current structures and practices and the potential benefits of changing those structures and practices, which can affect individual perspectives (II) and inform design work (CE)|
|2. Collective Discovery|CI|Outside of a traditional research context, groups of interested citizens or rights activists can use tools such as data access rights or freedom of information requests to gain data and information that can be compared and aggregated, resulting in new collective knowledge that could not be obtained individually). This knowledge can be used for collective influence (IE).|
|3. Creating new systems, models & organisations|CE|Using understandings of HDR needs and existing technological and social opportunities and constraints, innovators, researchers, developers and entrepreneurs can model or build new technologies and processes for treating personal data differently or establish new organisations to pursue HDR-related objectives - for example personal data lockers, data trusts, member associations, etc. New systems and organisations enable changes to the ways in which data holding organisations relate to their users (IE)|
|4. Creating new HDR capabilities & technologies|CE|Using understandings of HDR needs, interaction design and user-centred design approaches, researchers, developers and designers can design new forms of data interface or information interface, which provide people with new capabilities over their data, their life information and their personal data ecosystem. If put into practice, such innovations can change the way individuals relate to data, information and data holders (IE).|
|5. Defending digital rights & current HDR capabilities|CE|
