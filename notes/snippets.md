## Old Snippets


- other methodological research approaches I am building upon:
  - Boundary Objects [Star]
  - "Things to think with" [Brandt & Messeter]
  - Participatory co-design
  - Home visits [Mannay]


Our work is motivated by a digital civics agenda (Vines et al., 2013) - involving people in design so that their expertise can be used to shape design thinking, using boundary objects to allow different parties to connect and share experiences and expertise, and seeking to inspire societal change by allowing those in power to better empathise with the points of view of the citizens they serve. Another key element of our stance is a focus on improving the human relationships (in our case between support worker and supported families) so that citizens may be better empowered in their relations with the state (Vlachokyriakos et al., 2016).

###Â Old longform of trajectories of change (C7)

Table: Table 16. **Trajectories of change for improving Human Data Relations**.

|Change Trajectory|Quadrant|Explanation|
|:------------|-|:-------------------------------------------------------|
|1. Participatory Research|CI[^17]|Through groups of people working together (either researchers working with individuals (as in Case Study Two), or representatives of different groups coming together (as in the family/staff co-design workshops of Case Study One)) new understandings can be gained of the impacts of current structures and practices and the potential benefits of changing those structures and practices, which can affect individual perspectives (II) and inform design work (CE)|
|2. Collective Discovery|CI|Outside of a traditional research context, groups of interested citizens or rights activists can use tools such as data access rights or freedom of information requests to gain data and information that can be compared and aggregated, resulting in new collective knowledge that could not be obtained individually). This knowledge can be used for collective influence (IE).|
|3. Creating new systems, models & organisations|CE|Using understandings of HDR needs and existing technological and social opportunities and constraints, innovators, researchers, developers and entrepreneurs can model or build new technologies and processes for treating personal data differently or establish new organisations to pursue HDR-related objectives - for example personal data lockers, data trusts, member associations, etc. New systems and organisations enable changes to the ways in which data holding organisations relate to their users (IE)|
|4. Creating new HDR capabilities & technologies|CE|Using understandings of HDR needs, interaction design and user-centred design approaches, researchers, developers and designers can design new forms of data interface or information interface, which provide people with new capabilities over their data, their life information and their personal data ecosystem. If put into practice, such innovations can change the way individuals relate to data, information and data holders (IE).|
|5. Defending digital rights & current HDR capabilities|CE|

Old structure for 7.3

?_ The answers to this question are represented as discretely named ideas: either practical obstacles observed and practical opportunities identified. Within the simplified groupings of wants detailed above, these are conveyed as follows:

- _Obstacles_ are illustrated through learnings and insights from the projects (7.3.1.1.1, 7.3.1.2.1, 7.3.2.1.1, 7.3.2.2.1)
- _Opportunities_ are illustrated using conceptual models and design ideas from the projects (7.3.1.1.2, 7.3.1.2.2, 7.3.2.1.2, 7.3.2.2.2)

### Challenges and Opportunities in Life Information Utilisation

#### Understandable Data

##### Obstacles to Data Understandability

**Unrelatable data**.
[Meaningfulness / relatability -> relate it to people/places/events] [Context - Life - > need life interfaces]

**Lack of Legibility**.
[Information within Data -> Lack of Visualisations and Tools] [Complexity -> common formats/abstractions/summarisations]

**The Personal Data Diaspora**.
[Scatteredness -> holistic/unification, place to centralise] [My data is everywhere I am nowhere]

##### Improving Data Understandability

**Unified Life Information Storage**.
[Use standards & semantics to convert data to life information]. [Personal data Stores as place to put stuff] [Data Trusts]

**Meaning Extraction Software**.
[Build systems to extract meaning - interpreting and combining signals] [Semantic/content analytics]

**Life Information Interfaces**.
[presenting and visualising life information]
[Alternative Perspectives: temporal, entity-based/relational and geographical exploration] [relate to subjectivity]

#### Useable Data



##### Obstacles to Data Useability

**Trapped Data**.
[Trapped Data -> Force unlocking of data through technical means or regulatory influence]

**Integration Challenges**.
[Integration challenges -> Need to be able to bring data together and connect and combine]

**Lack of Malleability**.
[Lack of malleability -> need to be able to slice/group/view from different perspectives]

**Inability to Investigate**.
[inability to investigate -> enable questions, comparisons, investigations etc]

##### Improving Data Useability

**Exploratory Actions & Asking Tools**.
[supporting useful actions on data - filtering, referencing, cross referencing, conjecturing/whatiffing - data action verbs]
[asking tools rather than answers or insights]

**Life Information as Material**.
[data as material, interface features as tools to use that material] [an information operating system]

**PIM & SI capabilities**.
[supporting appropriation, annotation, organisation, curation, use & re-use] [reference 2.2.2 , including adaptability, re-use, etc]
[Reflection & Goals] [support goal setting, tracking and reflection]

#### Other Factors in Life Information Utilisation

**Motivation**.
[Motivation -> Showing the potential]

**Effort**.
[Effort -> doing as much as possible automatically, conjecture and assertion over blank pages. training rather than meticulous instructution.]

**Ecosystem Transparency**.
[how the other wants fit in, visibility as it pertains to Life info, transparency/oversight/involvement etc]

**Agency & Ecosystem Negotiability**.
[agency over trapped data (by tech or by companies (lead into next)]

### Challenges and Opportunities in Personal Data Ecosystem Control

#### Ecosystem Transparency

##### Obstacles to Ecosystem Transparency

**Introspective Practices**.
[hidden data and closed processes -> closed by default thinking -> encourage or legislate for openness.. e.g. data portability/access rights, rights to explanatione etc, but more needed]

**Proprietary, Incompatible Silos**.
[silos and motives towards closed proprietary systems -> highlight the pains]. [lack of standards, motivations against interoperability -> motivate standards and unconver opportunities for interoperability]

**Ecosystem Complexity**.
[complex data ecosystems, adtech]

**A Lack of Metadata**.
[lack of information *about* our data -> awareness and accountability even where access is difficult -> ] [show metadata diagram]

##### Improving Ecosystem Transparency

**Transparency through Regulation**.
[regulation - forcing openness transparency and interop. DSA ? ] [standards for data access - technical standards could make compliance easier to judge too]

**Ecosystem Mapping & Visualisation**.
[ecosystem visualisation and overviews]

**Collective Investigations**.
[collectives - as a means to compare and see more]

**Tap the Seams**.
[exploiting the seams - the battle for the seams]

**Bootstrap 'Data Understanding' Innovation**.
[standards creation and the benefits of enabling a 'data understanding' industry]

#### Ecosystem Negotiability

##### Obstacles to Ecosystem Negotiability

**The Datafication of the Self**.
[data self affects you but cannot see (proxy for involvement, unseen inferences etc)- > find a way to produce better digital selves]. [brings in LDM etc].

**The Technological Hegemony**.
[structural power, resource control, centralisation etc -> uneven landscape -> awareness as first step and systemic change needed to change. ]

**Digital Landscape Manipulation**.
[the four levers of infrastructural power. accumulation of info/surveillance as power. changing available information/actions as power]
[Controlling the landscape of what is knowable, and what is do-able -> recognise the importance of free information landscapes, and make them happen through tech or through regulation]

##### Improving Ecosystem Negotiability

**Regulating the Information Landscape**.
[-> better policies to protect the information landscape? DSA.]

**Unionisation**.
[collectives, as a means to ask collectively /demand change, supported by policy (uber, ref GDPR guidelines?)]

**Self-Profiling**
[better digital selves -> people as source of data. profiles and curated as better representation of self, ref past calls in C4&5 for stewardship, user-contributed data etc] [Can also hint at VRM style declarations] [Better data, which you control; but also less uncontrollable effects]

**Taking Back Power in the Browser**.
[-> exploiting the seams in order to produce new information presentations... ref JE paper (+colin?) -> web aug, firefox containers. Taking Back Power In The Browser, resist moves to apps]

**Free Information Landscapes**.
[the battle for landscape control - RSS, API, 3P interfaces, etc, Defending The Seams And Protecting Interface Freedom]. [information surfaces]. [reclamation and repurposing]

#### Other Factors in Personal Data Ecosystem Control

**Inclusive Information Flows**.
[Feeds and flows that loop in the data subject (default not opt in)] [Delay] [Lack of up to date insights / delay]. [Rivers of Information]

**Data Literacy**.
[data literacy and rights awareness - you should teach this in schools]. [Rights Inconsistencies]. [Inconsistent and difficult data rights offerings]



Obstacles to:

Data Legibility
Data Useability

Ecosystem transparency
Ecosystem Negotiability



APple bit c7

[CUT Such thinking is manifested in their hardware design too: phones that cannot be opened up, expanded or repaired; the removal of accessory ports, disk drives, and headphone jacks; increased controls over what can be installed on users' hard drives and which areas of disk can be modified. These changes simplify the technology and bring it to a more mainstream audience - something that iPhone and iPad designers must be given due credit for - but it happens at the cost of reducing user agency. ]


- MAIN POINT: That it is not just about Positive Change, there must also be Defensive Action, in the face of the active erosion of user autonomy (backref above diminishing agency). That this is an avenue of activist and grassroots work in its own right.
