## Old Snippets


- other methodological research approaches I am building upon:
  - Boundary Objects [Star]
  - "Things to think with" [Brandt & Messeter]
  - Participatory co-design
  - Home visits [Mannay]


Our work is motivated by a digital civics agenda (Vines et al., 2013) - involving people in design so that their expertise can be used to shape design thinking, using boundary objects to allow different parties to connect and share experiences and expertise, and seeking to inspire societal change by allowing those in power to better empathise with the points of view of the citizens they serve. Another key element of our stance is a focus on improving the human relationships (in our case between support worker and supported families) so that citizens may be better empowered in their relations with the state (Vlachokyriakos et al., 2016).
