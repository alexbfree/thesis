[Target 8,000 words]

In this chapter we bring together the findings of chapters 4 & 5 & 6, to answer the research question and conclude the thesis.

### The Power of Data holders
[Target X words]

- Looking at gaining agency as shifting the locus of decision Making in a relationship.
- Introduce and reference some models of power/data-power
  - Foucault
  - Zuboff
  - Habermas
  - power of Facebook/data serfs etc
  - other models...
- then moving into the ways in which organisations maintain power today
  - Care side:
    - closed databases
    - non inclusive processes
  - Commercial side:
    - removing the seams
    - lack of human contact
    - limiting data access and use, non-interoperability etc
- What are the practical ways to challenge this
  - web augmentation,
  - GDPR-based relentless pressure>dashboards,
  - greater involvement in processes (though that is challenging)
  - better data literacy and education
  - Personal data stores as solution - huge challenges of building and designing, need to model for everyday life, hard to codify life.

Wrapping up everything in a few simple paragraphs and making recommendations for the future (research wise, whereas c6 focussed more on the practical). Talk about positioning digital civics wise.
