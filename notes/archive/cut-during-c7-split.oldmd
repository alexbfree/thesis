hwat follows is not a roadmap, but rather a snapshot of ongoing work, identified challenges and known opportunities.

It serves as an anthology of reference material, based on my research and design experience from six years work to understand and advance HDR. A good high-level understanding of the landscape combined with some specific ideas to work with should be valuable for anyone working in the HDR space. The goal is to empower HDR reformers through the insights so that they might 'hit the ground running'. [8](#8) identifies the main obstacles that one must face in pursuit of the HDR objectives. [9](#9) is solution-focused, considering the nuts and bolts of _how_ we might begin to tackle the obstacles of [8](#8) in pursuit of the HDR objectives


, and offers four specific approaches or trajectories for change, framed using _Theories of Change (ToC)_ [[9.1](#9.1)]. Within each of these four trajectories, specific opportunities are described or referenced in varying detail [^11]. Key designerly insights are highlighted in inset boxes throughout these two sections.

In [7.5](#7.5), the contribution of this chapter is summarised, again with reference to ToC thinking, in answer to the [expanded research question](#exRQ).

[TODO ADD TEXT HERE - now we will dive into this field, start out on the road]




Considering the [expanded research question](#exRQ) above generates further questions. Like SI's _barriers cascade_ [@li2010], what barriers exist that inhibit the building or adoption of human-centric technologies? What opportunities might overcome these barriers? How can we catalyse progress toward _MyData_'s human-centric agenda [@mydata2017declaration]? What challenges are faced when attempting to build human-centric technologies for today's world? Building on an understanding of human experience of the data-centric world, can we more provide an outlook for PDE design & development and define a _research agenda_ for the next step of tackling the PDE challenge?
