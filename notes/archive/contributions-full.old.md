### An Understanding of what People want from Personal Data{#1.2.1}

Through the concluding sections of Chapters [4](#chapter-4) and [5](#chapter-5), the reader will be able to see that research participants across both studies (and the pilot study) shared common issues around personal data. These commonalities provide the answers to RQ1 [[3.3.1](#RQ1)] and RQ2 [[3.3.2](#RQ2)], which form the first two contributions C1 and C2:

**<a name="c1">C1</a>: An understanding of What People Want in Direct Data Relations**

Section [6.1](#6.1) answers RQ1 by explaining that people have three specific desires for direct relations with data–for data to be:

- visible [[6.1.1](#6.1.1)],
- understandable [[6.1.2](#6.1.2)], and
- useable<sup>[11](#fn11)</sup> [[6.1.3](#6.1.3)].

**<a name="c2">C2</a>: An Understanding of What People Want in Indirect Data Relations**

Section [6.2](#6.2) answers RQ2 by explaining the three things people want when they have an indirect relationship to their data because it is held by someone else, such as a service provider:

- process transparency [[6.2.1](#6.2.1)],
- individual oversight [[6.2.2](#6.2.2)], and
- involvement in processes and decision making [[6.2.3](#6.2.3)].

### Establishing a New Field: Human Data Relations{#1.2.2}

**<a name="c3">C3</a>: The Synthesis and Formulation of the Field of Human Data Relations (HDR)**.

At the highest level, this thesis contributes a new field of research and innovation, _Human Data Relations (HDR)_. [Chapter 2](#chapter-2) reviews existing literature and prior work to explain the problems of data-centrism and limited access to data [[2.1](#2.1)]; personal information management and interaction [[2.2](#2.2)]; and human-centric perspectives on data [[2.3](#2.3)].
From this baseline, the participatory academic enquiry into the lived realities described in Chapters [4](#chapter-4) and [5](#chapter-5) lead to a synthesis [Chapter 6](#chapter-6) of what people want in data relations.
[Chapter 7](#chapter-7) formalises this defined field of academic and practical endeavour, Human Data Relations [[7.3](#7.3)], as the pursuit of four specific objectives:

  - data awareness and understanding
  - data useability
  - data ecosystem awareness and understanding
  - data ecosystem negotiability

**<a name="c4">C4</a>: A clear delineation of two primary motivators for individuals seeking better HDR**

Section [7.6](#7.6), informed by both the Case Studies and the peripheral activities [[7.2OLD](#7.2OLD)], clarifies the two driving motivations for pursuing better HDR:

  - Life Information Utilisation [[7.6.1](#7.6.1)], and
  - Personal Data Ecosystem Control [[7.6.2](#7.6.2)].

**<a name="c5">C5</a>: A map of the HDR landscape, identifying obstacles and insights**

The goal of this thesis is to set the stage for future research and innovation in the newly-defined space of Human Data Relations. Across Chapters [8](#8) and [9](#9), the landscape of HDR is mapped out from multiple perspectives.

[Chapter 8](#8) maps out eight obstacles to the pursuit of the HDR objectives, as well as four obstacles that exist in the solution space across all four, including:

  - the personal data diaspora,
  - the intractable data self,
  - immobile, illegible and unmalleable data,
  - hegemony and active diminishing of user agency by data holders,
  - closed, introspective and insular practices,
  - a lack of demand and investment in HDR from individuals and organisations, and
  - insufficient machine understanding of human data.

To begin to address these obstacles, thirteen [Insights](#inset-boxes) are explained that could seed future research and innovation towards tackling these obstacles:

  - [1](#principle-1). Life information makes data relatable.
  - [2](#principle-2). Data needs to be united and unified.
  - [3](#principle-3). Data must be transformed into a versatile material.
  - [4](#principle-4). Ecosystem information is an antidote to digital life complexity.
  - [5](#principle-5). We must know data's provenance.
  - [6](#principle-6). Data holders exploit four levers of power to manipulate the digital landscape.
  - [7](#principle-7). We need new human-centred information systems that serve human values, relieve pain and deliver new life capabilities.
  - [8](#principle-8). We need to teach computers to understand human information.
  - [9](#principle-9). Individual GDPR requests can compel companies to change data practices.
  - [10](#principle-10). Collectives can compare and unify their data and use it to demand change.
  - [11](#principle-11). Automating the identification of entities can enhance machine understanding and unburden life interface users.
  - [12](#principle-12). The 'seams' of Digital Services need to be identified, exploited and protected.
  - [13](#principle-13). It is possible (and necessary) to demonstrate business benefits of transparency and human-centricity.

**<a name="c6">C6</a>: Four identified trajectories for advancing Human Data Relations**

[Chapter 9](#chapter-9) explains, with detailed real-world examples and original design work from the author's peripheral work in industry, four distinct approaches for furthering the cause of HDR:

  1. Discovery-Driven Activism [[9.2](#9.2)]
  2. Building the Human-Centric Future [[9.3](#9.3)]
  3. Defending User Autonomy and Hacking the Information Landscape [[9.4](#9.4)]
  4. Teaching, Championing and Selling the HDR Vision [[9.5](#9.5)]

**<a name="c7">C7</a>: A reframing of data literacy for the HDR space**

Section [9.5.1](#9.5.1) broadens existing conceptions of _data literacy_ that include critical thinking, numerical analysis and arguing using data, to describe additional skills that people will need to develop if they are to become fully _HDR-literate_:

  - appreciating the intrinsic value of personal data to themselves and others;
  - understanding the implications of organisational data use;
  - recognising why portable data and platform/data separation is important;
  - understanding one's data rights enough to confidently execute and evaluate responses;
  - identifying diminishing agency and erosions of a free and fair information landscape.

### Additional Contributions in the Early Help and Civic Data Context{#1.2.3}

**<a name="c8">C8</a>: Validation and documentation of supported families' attitudes and desires around civic data**

The pilot study [[1.3.1](#1.3.1)] and its continuation through Case Study One [[Chapter 4](#chapter-4)] was useful to validate that people do feel the effects of data records about them and, contrary to early expectations, do care about data access. People want continuing rights, control and visibility over their personal data, so that it remains fair, accurate and meaningful.  Furthermore, the lived experiences of supported families show how data can become a proxy for human involvement, and that this can be harmful and disempowering. In particular:

- Supported families need meaningful interaction with and through data,
- They need to be given a voice to explain, challenge or add context to data, and
- Transparency over data can improve trust in support services.

**<a name="c9">C9</a>: _Shared Data Interaction_: A proposed model for more efficient and empowering social support relationships that embraces human-centricity**.

Providers of care want to be more data-centric to improve accuracy [[4.1.2](#4.1.2), [4.2.3](#4.2.3)], while supported families want a more human, less data-centric treatment. [4.2.4](#4.2.4) describes a novel model that has the potential to address both parties' conflicting needs and enhance the support relationship: _Shared Data Interaction_. While this was not evaluated in the field, it is consistent with emergent practices [[4.3.1](#4.3.1)], and–after thorough exploration by participants [[Table 3.1](#table-3.1)]–was perceived to be beneficial. The expected benefits (and challenges) of such an approach are explored in [4.4.3](#4.4.3). The success of this study's methodology [[3.4.2](#3.4.2)] provides further evidence for the effectiveness of bringing people together around representations of data, echoing other researchers' work on _boundary objects_ [@star1989] and _things to think with_ [@brandt2004].

### Additional Contributions in the GDPR and Everyday Data Context {#1.2.4}

**<a name="c10">C10: A model to understand the five different origins of held personal data**

[Table 5.2](#table-5.2) describes five different types of data organisations can hold about individuals:

  - Volunteered Data
  - Observed Data
  - Derived Data
  - Acquired Data
  - Metadata

This model has been used during design and ideation sessions at BBC R&D. It has also been used and cited within Sitra/Hestia.ai's _digipower_ investigation [[ARI7.2OLD](#ARI7.2OLD)], both for explaining data holding to participants and as a frame for data analysis [@bowyer2022hestia; @pidoux2022].

**<a name="c11">C11</a>: A rich understanding of the lived experience of accessing data using GDPR rights and of motivations for GDPR data access**

Case Study Two fills a research gap in understanding the human experience of using GDPR to access one's personal data. The findings [[5.4](#5.4)] confirm previous research that compliance is poor and returned data often incomplete [@ausloos2018], and contribute new knowledge by uncovering specific attitudes such as resignation about data sacrifice, disappointment in GPDR handling by service providers, and a lack of answers to questions. Specific motivations for GDPR data access (and hence more widely for HDR) are enumerated, providing a valuable starting set of requirements for future research and innovation (see [Table 5.4](#table-5.4) and the supplemental materials of [@bowyer2022gdpr]).

**<a name="c12">C12</a>: Evidence for the impact of knowledge about data handling practices on provider trust and perceived individual power**

A particularly novel and surprising discovery from Case Study Two was that the use of GDPR rights and privacy policy analyses to scrutinise data-holding service providers often resulted in a _decrease_ in trust in those same data holders. At the same time, GDPR use on the whole failed to provide a net increase in perceived individual power; it was not empowering people and hence not meeting its own goals. Further analysis of these patterns also showed that data handling practices are critical to trust and consumer loyalty [[5.3.4](#5.3.4); [5.5.2](#5.5.2)]].

**<a name="c13">C13</a>: Guidance for policymakers, data holders and individuals on how to improve HDR**

Synthesis and analysis of participant experiences in Case Study Two enabled the production of specific guidance [[5.5](#5.5)] for parties involved in data relationships:

  1. Policymakers and DPOs should do better at enforcing GDPR rights. Regulators need to legislate to improve response quality and to mandate data holders to support data subjects in understanding data.
  2. Data-holding service providers should improve transparency over data and data handling process, and could seize the opportunities of more inclusive and collaborative models of individual data access to improve trust, empower users and reduce their own liability.
  3. Individuals should recognise the critical role of held personal data in modern life, embrace opportunities to access and exploit their own data and use data access rights to hold service providers to account.

**<a name="c14">C14</a>: A proto-methodology for educating individuals about held data, data access and the data ecosystem**

While it was not designed as a methodological contribution nor formally evaluated as such within the scope of this thesis, the guided-data-retrieval-and-interview approach of Case Study Two [[5.2](#5.2)] has proven to be valuable and replicable as means to connect people with their held data and conduct research at that intersection point. The creation of this methodology resulted in this author being approached and employed as lead researcher of Hestia.ai/Sitra's digipower investigation [@härkönen2022project], which adopted Case Study Two's methodology, with some adaptation and broadening of scope, for an extensive EU study auditing and understanding the power of data holders in the data economy [@bowyer2022hestia; @pidoux2022; @härkönen2022report].
