FQ16
_"[Families need to] feel they're being involved. […] [We need to be able to] sit together and say, 'Right, that's the information I'll allow you to share. I don't want that bit shared. But this bit, because it will help me and the family […]'. Say in this [scenario] family, she might have been married before and had domestic violence so she doesn't want that bit shared, that's in the past. So it's [only] certain up-to-date information about the family [that would be shared] because this [the family suggested by the data] isn't her family."_ [Parent, SQ76]

SQ76
Let's say dad was sexually abused when he was a child, I think that's important that we know that because dad could have mental health problems now which would be a result and we didn't know that and he didn't want to speak about it

SQ77
[Researcher] Was that fair and appropriate and is that accurate in terms of [what data has been viewed]?
[Worker 1] I think it would be fair... I think for me it's fair if it's current because...
[Worker 2] It can only be fair if it's complete, you've got all the information there.


SQ78
> So maybe you've got groups of young people who are, I don't know, there's something going on maybe in [local park], you've got some antisocial behaviour and they might be putting on their things that they like to do it with their friends. Then we pull from that, actually you've got a group of these young people who are involved in this. Then from that you can have focus groups. So I think we all as family partners know that we've got groups of young people where they are hanging out together so instead of just being one worker, I might think, "Well actually, there's so many people in my team have got these kids so we can have a focus group."
