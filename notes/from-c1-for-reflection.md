I believe this is the best way to share the HDR insights I have gained along this six-year journey that go beyond traditional academic findings.


This dual approach of focusing the PhD on empirical grounded academic research, while also operating outside of the PhD as a researcher and developer working on real-world innovation in the same space, will produce a powerful feedback loop where practical realities of tackling the problem space can inform the participatory research explorations of the space, and vice-versa, feeding into the action research cycle [3.2] of the PhD through more than just the participatory empirical research itself.


It has been a tremendous privilege to spend six years understanding in great detail the nature of the problems facing our data-centric society, to map those impacts into to tangible needs, and to be able to map out the landscape for improving the way we relate to data. As well as allowing me to discover grounded evidence to quantify and qualify the losses of agency I had observed and theorised, this programme has given me space to experiment with using using both GDPR and web-scraping to access data and push boundaries, and to design and prototype new models and views of data and of information which have transformed the way I look at digital information and how we relate to it, and which I hope can help others in the same way. Looking forward, this opportunity has opened doors that have enabled me to begin to put these learnings into action, working on important projects [see [7.1.1](7.1.1)] with Connected Health Cities, BBC R&D, and Hestia.ai to explore how data interaction reforms can be realised in practice, and how we can come not just innovators but social data activists to begin to have an impact and to build that better future. It is the journey of a lifetime, and also one that is in many ways just beginning. I hope that my work and this thesis can, in some small way, contribute to a better, more human-centric digital world, and I can't wait to see where this leads.
