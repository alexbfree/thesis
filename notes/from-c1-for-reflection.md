I believe this is the best way to share the HDR insights I have gained along this six-year journey that go beyond traditional academic findings.


This dual approach of focusing the PhD on empirical grounded academic research, while also operating outside of the PhD as a researcher and developer working on real-world innovation in the same space, will produce a powerful feedback loop where practical realities of tackling the problem space can inform the participatory research explorations of the space, and vice-versa, feeding into the action research cycle [3.2] of the PhD through more than just the participatory empirical research itself.
