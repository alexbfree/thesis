This research is situated in the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) discipline, which means that **design** (both participatory co-design and expert-informed user-centred design [[3.5](#3.5)]) forms a key part of the approach to exploring the problem space. However, despite initial consideration, it was explicitly decided that **field evaluation of particular interface designs or processes would not be done as part of this PhD**. Given the broad and far-reaching nature of the problem space described, such work would be technically difficult and, highly resource-intensive and time-consuming. The formation of clear underlying models around data attitudes and needs is viewed as a more critical first step that should and must precede any implementation of systems or processes aiming to improve the way in which people can acquire improved agency and negotiability _'in the wild'_. Nonetheless, given this research's purpose of enabling others to have meaningful impact on the world, a significant piece of this thesis ([Chapter 7](#chapter-7)) will be dedicated to **sharing the designerly thoughts, models and ideas** I formulate both from talking to participants of the Case Studies, and from parallel research and development activities I will conduct alongside the primary investigative research of this PhD. Therefore, while this thesis will not be able to be definitive about which precise interfaces, processes or practices will succeed in combatting the power imbalance over data, it will not shy away from offering untested theories, design ideas and insights, originating from both **participant-expressed needs** and **my own research-and-practice-informed expertise**, which are presented so that future researchers and innovators might explore or evaluate them and build upon the contributions of this thesis.

This dual approach of focusing the PhD on grounded academic research, while also operating outside of the PhD as a researcher and developer working on real-world innovation in the same space, will produce a **powerful feedback loop** where practical realities of tackling the problem space can inform the participatory research explorations of the space, and vice-versa, feeding into the **action research cycle** [[3.2.2](#3.2.2)] of the PhD through more than just the participatory investigative research itself.

participatory research that aims to collect interview transcripts and other data as primary data sources that can be examined to

conduct participatory research in two different contexts to understand and synthesise a clear model of








To do this, two key settings in which individuals have some remit to _'look behind the curtain'_ of the previously opaque data-centric organisations they interact with have been identified, creating spaces where individuals can be interviewed and probed to uncover their attitudes and desires:

1. Supported families, who meet with _'Early Help'_ support workers whose role is to access civic data to understand and empower those individuals to improve their lives - forming the context for Case Study One of this thesis [[Chapter 4](#chapter-4)]; and
2. Ordinary British and European citizens, who gained new legal rights via 2018's _GDPR_ legislation, enabling them to request copies of held personal data along with other relevant information from the companies and service providers in their lives - this forms the context for Case Study Two of this thesis [[Chapter 5](#chapter-5)].




These Case Studies were designed to enable the collecting of interview transcripts and other data as primary data sources that can be examined in order to attempt to answer two key research questions (RQ):

- **RQ1. What is the human experience of personal data, and what do people want from their data?**
- **RQ2. What role does data play in people's service relationships, and how could relationships involving data be improved?**




Given the societal importance of this problem as outlined at the start, the goal of this research and of this thesis is **to produce knowledge and insights** that can enable researchers, innovators and activists to make progress in **redressing the power balance between individuals and data holders** and in delivering **increased agency and negotiability** to individuals. Informed by , this objective will be approached by conducting participatory research in relevant contexts, to understand and synthesise a clear model of how people relate to data, how they understand and use it, and what they need from it in order to thrive and to meet their own goals.
