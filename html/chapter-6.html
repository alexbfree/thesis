Discussion I: An Understanding of Human Data Relations</h1>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“For a participatory system to work, you need: a plausible
promise, an effective tool, and an acceptable bargain.”</em><br /> – Clay
Shirky (author and journalist focused on the social and economic effects
of Internet technologies)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It will be already evident to the reader that there are significant
overlaps and parallels to be drawn across the findings and discursive
insights in Case Study One and Two. In this first discussion chapter, I
will draw on both Chapter 4 and Chapter 5 to produce a unified summary
of findings and insights in terms of the first two research subquestions
RQ1 and RQ2. To recap on the research objectives expressed in <a href="#3.3">3.3</a>, these two RQs are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>RQ1: “What is the human experience of personal data, and
what do people want from their data?”</strong></li>
<li><strong>RQ2: “What role does data play in people’s service
relationships and how could relationships involving data be
improved?”</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The answers to these research questions are best expressed as an
understanding of individual <em>wants</em> relating to data. The word
‘want’ is used here in a broader sense than its everyday meaning,
referring to the <em>lack</em> of something that would be beneficial
(which may or may not be accompanied by conscious desire). By framing
our accumulated understandings from the Case Studies in this way, we are
exposing both the problem - the things that individuals do not have or
cannot do, while also identifying the goals that any imagined solutions
or improvements to the status quo would need to address. It logically
follows that any solution that better delivers on individual <em>data
wants</em> will lead to improved relations between individuals and their
data. This is how we can conceptualise “Human Data Relations” as alluded
to in the title of this thesis, and indeed this gives us a yardstick
against which to understand what “better” means, which will be explored
in Chapter 7. <em>“Human Data Relations”</em> is a term that I introduce
here to expand upon the established theory of Human Data Interaction
<span class="citation" data-cites="mortier2013 mortier2014">(<a href="#ref-mortier2013" role="doc-biblioref">Mortier <em>et al.</em>,
2013</a>, <a href="#ref-mortier2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span> in light of the Case Studies’
findings from a more sociotechnical, interpersonal point of view. Humans
have two kinds of relationships with data: <em>direct</em> interaction
(such as through an interface in an app or website) and
<em>indirect</em> interaction (through interacting with services,
providers or individual representatives who themselves have access to
personal data about the individual). Thus, Human Data Relations is a
term that can encompass both the relationship humans have with their
data, but also the relationships they have in which data plays an
indirect role. In this context, RQ1 and RQ2 map quite cleanly onto these
two types of Human Data Relations, and in answering RQ1 we can identify
what people want from direct data relations, while RQ2 helps provide an
answer as to what people want from indirect data relations.</p>

<h2 data-number="6.1"><span class="header-section-number">6.1</span>
Answering RQ1: What do people want in <em>direct</em> data
relations?</h2>
<p>By comparing and grouping elements of the findings from Case Study
One (see 4.3) and from Case Study Two (see 5.4), three distinct data
wants are evident when considering <em>direct</em> data relations. All
data about individuals needs to be:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><em>Visible</em>: People need to have knowledge of data about them
and an ability to see it and effectively access it;</li>
<li><em>Understandable</em>: People need to be able to interpret this
data to extract meaningful information from it (and about it), including
through visualisations and summaries; and</li>
<li><em>Useable</em>: People need to be able to take action upon this
data, including exploring it, asking questions of it, using it to serve
their own goals, and gaining personal value from it.</li>
</ol>
<p>These wants are detailed in the following sections:</p>
<section id="want-d1" data-number="1.1.1">
<h3 data-number="6.1.1"><span class="header-section-number">6.1.1</span>
Visible</h3>
<p><strong>Data matters to every individual now, in a way that
previously it did not.</strong> As described in 2.1.2, the role of data
in our everyday lives has changed; data has become a material used by
businesses to shape our world. In 2.2.2 and 2.2.4 I outlined how this
change has practically manifested itself in people’s lives; where once
data was viewed as <em>ours</em> for our personal reference and use, the
emergence of complex multi-party data ecosystems has meant that personal
data management has become a sociotechnical &amp; societal problem, not
a practical individual one. In the past when businesses were more local,
more personal and less data-centric, the data that businesses held about
us was minimal and much less significant to our lives than the human
relationships we had with those businesses. Businesses grew and data
began to be considered as a resource to be processed at scale for
customer insight and marketing exploitation, and though we didn’t
realise it, our need to understand those processes to protect one’s own
interests, began to grow. In the past, you didn’t need to become aware
of data storage and use, because it had little effect. Now, data has
become a substitute for direct communication with the individual being
served, as my research in both public sector (<span class="citation" data-cites="bowyer2018family">(<a href="#ref-bowyer2018family" role="doc-biblioref">Bowyer <em>et al.</em>, 2018</a>)</span> and 4.3.3)
and the private sector (5.4.3.3) has shown. In both domains, people do
not have awareness, let alone access, to the extent of data that exists
about them. In 5.4.4.1 we saw individuals feeling that companies forced
them to hand over data in exchange for service access, and then
subsequently maintaining power over them through holding that data,
using it to make decisions, and denying them access to that data or even
be clear about what data is held.</p>
<p><strong>Data sacrifice is now required for many services, putting
individuals at risk.</strong> Be it the personal financial, health and
lifestyle data collected on an Early Help assessment form when a family
signs up for Early Help support (4.1.2), or the contact details, payment
information and preferences provided when individuals register with
commercial service providers such as insurance providers or streaming
media platforms (5.4.4.1), supplying your personal data is required to
access services. Consent to hold and use this data is enforced upon
signup, through waiver forms or Terms &amp; Conditions agreements.
Service providers in both sectors see the acquisition of more personal
data as beneficial to their operations, be it support workers wanting to
gain more data about families’ lives (4.2.3, 4.2.6), or commercial
providers using trackers to gain more insight about users that they can
exploit for advertising <span class="citation" data-cites="binns2022">(<a href="#ref-binns2022" role="doc-biblioref">Binns, 2022</a>)</span>. In both domains, this
sacrifice is seen to have an emotional effect on people, ranging from
curiosity to fear and distrust (<span class="citation" data-cites="bowyer2018family">(<a href="#ref-bowyer2018family" role="doc-biblioref">Bowyer <em>et al.</em>, 2018</a>)</span> and
5.4.4). Such fears are well-founded, with mistreatment through incorrect
data known in both settings (4.2.2, 5.4.4.1). While data holders almost
certainly do not <em>intend</em> to cause harm, data <em>can</em> be
‘used against you’ (P2’s quote in 5.4.4.1) <span class="citation" data-cites="kroger2021 strohmayer2021">(<a href="#ref-kroger2021" role="doc-biblioref">Kröger, Miceli and Müller, 2021</a>; <a href="#ref-strohmayer2021" role="doc-biblioref">Strohmayer <em>et
al.</em>, 2021</a>)</span>. In providers’ eyes, people are now
represented through data. Despite the fact that data is never truly
objective <span class="citation" data-cites="gitelman2013 taylor2015">(<a href="#ref-gitelman2013" role="doc-biblioref">Gitelman, 2013</a>; <a href="#ref-taylor2015" role="doc-biblioref">Taylor <em>et al.</em>, 2015</a>)</span> and a
recognition (at least on the public sector side) that a data record can
never tell the full story (4.2.6 and <span class="citation" data-cites="bowyer2018family">(<a href="#ref-bowyer2018family" role="doc-biblioref">Bowyer <em>et al.</em>, 2018</a>)</span>), the data
record becomes the object to be administered, rather than the individual
<span class="citation" data-cites="cornford2013 zuboff2019">(<a href="#ref-cornford2013" role="doc-biblioref">Cornford, Baines and
Wilson, 2013</a>; <a href="#ref-zuboff2019" role="doc-biblioref">Zuboff,
2019</a>)</span>, and this in itself creates risk - through mishandling
or inaccuracy. Given the data record is seen as a source of truth
(4.1.2, 5.5.3), it is vital that such information remains <em>fair</em>,
and <em>accurate</em>; this is especially important in the commercial
sector, where people are only just beginning to become aware of data
misuses and data exploitations that are actually happening <span class="citation" data-cites="avast2022databrokers chang2018 mcnamee2019 zuckerman2021">(<a href="#ref-chang2018" role="doc-biblioref">Chang, 2018</a>; <a href="#ref-mcnamee2019" role="doc-biblioref">McNamee, 2019</a>; <a href="#ref-zuckerman2021" role="doc-biblioref">Zuckerman, 2021</a>; <a href="#ref-avast2022databrokers" role="doc-biblioref"><span>‘<span class="nocase">Data Brokers: Everything You Need to Know</span>’</span>,
2022</a>)</span>. Ensuring fairness and accuracy of held data cannot be
verified without individuals’ awareness of data held about them.</p>
<p><strong>Once data has been sacrificed, it enters a closed and opaque
ecosystem, where the individual loses access and becomes
unaware</strong> of that data’s storage and use (Luger and Rodden’s
‘point of severance’ <span class="citation" data-cites="luger2013">(<a href="#ref-luger2013" role="doc-biblioref">Luger and Rodden,
2013</a>)</span>). What was previously available for individuals to see
becomes inaccessible and invisible. In the Early Help context, this
manifested as families having a lack of awareness or direct access to
data held about them and having to rely on support workers as
gatekeepers to choose to inform or show them aspects of their data
(4.1.1,4.5). In the commercial context, the situation is perhaps even
worse, as not only is there rarely any kind of data viewing interface,
there is not even a gatekeeper who might make people aware of their data
and its use; and even if someone becomes motivated to gain awareness,
the GDPR leaves them in the dark; in 62% of cases, the data that
companies own privacy policies stated they collect, was not returned,
and data that was returned was complete in only 22% of cases (5.3.2). In
both contexts, no awareness is gained unless the information is actively
sought. This means that the vast majority of people, busy and unaware,
remain so. This is problematic because people cannot judge data accuracy
or protect themselves from risk, because they may not even be aware of
certain data’s existence and use, or be able to access it even when they
are.</p>
<p><strong>People want to see data which is hidden from them</strong>.
In the SILVER project (3.4.1.1, 4.2.2), and my prior work with families
(<span class="citation" data-cites="bowyer2018family">Bowyer <em>et
al.</em> (<a href="#ref-bowyer2018family" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>), and in Case Study One (4.2.6,
4.3.2, 4.4.2), families wanted to see what data was held about them
(“what they’ve got on me”). They wanted to be actively kept informed and
to have the ability to see if data was fair and accurate. In the
commercial context, the same feelings were found; participants expressed
a great desire to see and know what companies are storing about them,
especially data collected or inferred about them without their
involvement. This is not just a desire, but a need, given that data can
have impact on their daily lives as it is used to inform decisions on
how content is presented and recommended to them, and what services they
are advertised, offered or can access (5.5.3). We also see from Case
Study Two that awareness is not just a binary; awareness includes having
an appreciation of why the existence and use of certain data is
significant and what its implications might be. Article 13.2.f of the
GDPR <span class="citation" data-cites="gdpr2018art13">(<a href="#ref-gdpr2018art13" role="doc-biblioref"><span>‘<span class="nocase">Article 13: Information to be provided where personal
data are collected from the data subject</span>’</span>,
2020</a>)</span> states that, at least in the case of automated
decision-making, people are entitled to meaningful information about the
significance of the processing of their data, yet such explanations were
typically not given to participants of Case Study Two.</p>
<p><strong>Effective access to held data is required for
visibility</strong>. Having gained awareness of data held and of the
significance of it, people want that to be accompanied by meaningful
access to the data itself. In Case Study One (4.3.2.1, 4.4.2), we saw
families and support workers recognise the need to accommodate the
differences in families’ digital literacy, mental and physical
handicaps, and technology skills while providing them access to the data
held about them. This mirrors Gurstein’s call for ‘effective access for
everyone’ <span class="citation" data-cites="gurstein2011">(<a href="#ref-gurstein2011" role="doc-biblioref">Gurstein,
2011</a>)</span>, which was detailed in 2.1.4. Four aspects in
particular are relevant here: the content and formatting of the data
(which should support different levels of linguistic and computer
literacy), the capabililities made available in terms of software,
hardware and Internet access (sufficiently powerful, sufficiently
available and affordable), and skills (ensuring that individuals are
able to interpret the data). In Case Study Two, we saw several
participants feeling that data was delivered in too-technical formats
(5.4.3.2), or that they lacked the skill to properly interpret the data
(5.4.3.1). Effective access and interpreting data goes beyond visibility
of data and includes understandability, which is explored in the next
section.</p>
<p><strong>Visibility of, and access to, data must be timely, and
ongoing</strong>. Given the ever-changing nature of data (and indeed of
the lives of the people it represents), occasional or one-off access is
not sufficient. In Human-Data Interaction theory, this concept is
described as having <em>negotiability</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="mortier2013 mortier2014">(<a href="#ref-mortier2013" role="doc-biblioref">Mortier <em>et al.</em>, 2013</a>, <a href="#ref-mortier2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span>: the
ability to re-evaluate data and associated decisions as contexts change
externally. It is also mentioned by Gurstein, who points out that
time-limited access to data would not be effective <span class="citation" data-cites="gurstein2011">(<a href="#ref-gurstein2011" role="doc-biblioref">Gurstein, 2011</a>)</span>. In the Early Help
context, families wanted access to their data outside of support
meetings; this implies some sort of self-service interfaces being
available, that you can use <em>in your own time</em> rather than being
reliant on the support worker as gatekeeper. People wanted to see all
data about them directly, through a personal interface, as reflected in
their workshop designs (4.3.2.3). This echoed findings of my earlier
work with families, which had identified a need for continuing rights
and visibility of data over time, in order enable vigilance over keeping
data accurate and meaningful as life changes (<span class="citation" data-cites="bowyer2018family">Bowyer <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#ref-bowyer2018family" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>).
Timeliness also implies that access to an up-to-date view of the data
does not require special and ongoing effort by the individual, it is
always available. Both support workers and supported families saw value
in notification feeds about changes to data records (4.3.3.3), so that
changes are discovered and can be acted upon without having to wait for
the next support meeting. In the commercial context we can see that GDPR
provides a form of access that is not at all timely. The 30-day delay on
request processing guarantees that data will be out of date by the time
it is viewed, and individuals must repeatedly make GDPR requests to
maintain an up-to-date view (and in doing so, they risk the imposition
of charges as GDPR states that requests should not be excessive and that
fees can be levied for additional copies). This lack of timeliness in
the design of GDPR data access motivates my third suggestion to
policymakers in 5.5.1, that they should offer ongoing access rather than
the one-off delivery of data packages.</p>
<p><strong>For held data to become visible, systemic support is needed,
including governance, advocacy and assistance</strong>. Offering access
to data is not solvable at a purely technical level. Even a well-built
data interface with 24/7 access would not provide the depth and breadth
of visibility people want. As observed in Case Study Two, even those
companies that provide instant data access portals such as Google and
Facebook did not provide participants with all the data they desired,
nor all the answers they sought (5.4.2.3), and most companies offered
neglible follow-up support after data had been delivered (5.3.3).
Further investigations into data access conducted as part of the
#digipower investigation (3.4.3.4) confirmed Case Study Two’s findings
that SAR requests and data portals rarely provide insight into some of
the most desired types of data including derived and acquired data and
data transfers. Effective access and visibility also requires advocacy
<span class="citation" data-cites="gurstein2011">(<a href="#ref-gurstein2011" role="doc-biblioref">Gurstein,
2011</a>)</span>: people require support and training to make use of
their data. Furthermore, given the insufficient breadth of returned data
from companies (5.3.3, 5.4.2.2) and near-total lack of access to data on
the public sector side (4.3.2.2, 4.3.2.3), it is clear that external
governance <span class="citation" data-cites="gurstein2011">(<a href="#ref-gurstein2011" role="doc-biblioref">Gurstein, 2011</a>)</span>
to ensure effective access is needed. Without the sort of pressure on
data-holders that only policymakers can exert, organisations will not be
compelled to provide richer responses or better information-access
support (5.4.2.2, 5.5.1), and while small improvements can be achieved
through individual action, people generally lack the means to
effectively <em>demand</em> the increased visibility required (5.5.3).
The impact of this lack of governance is most keenly felt in the
PDE/MyData space (2.3.4), where emergent actors seek to encourage
data-holding organisations to enable greater information access so that
they might build better data access tools for individuals, but are
hampered by a lack of top-down governance supporting their requests as
well as a lack of funding and investment by data-holders in data
advocacy.</p>
<p><strong>If data is not visible, this can lead to subjection,
alienation and exclusion</strong>. Throughout both Case Studies, we have
seen the negative psychological effects of people not being able to see
their data. Families in both my earlier work with families <span class="citation" data-cites="bowyer2018family">(<a href="#ref-bowyer2018family" role="doc-biblioref">Bowyer <em>et
al.</em>, 2018</a>)</span> and Case Study One were caused significant
worries by not being able to see their data. People do not want to be
treated like <em>subjects</em> (in either sense of one being subjugated
<span class="citation" data-cites="bowyer2018family">(<a href="#ref-bowyer2018family" role="doc-biblioref">Bowyer <em>et
al.</em>, 2018</a>)</span>, or as a topic being discussed) and reducing
people to a set of assertions in data causes them to become, in effect
‘objects to be administered’, which is harmful and disempowering (4.2.3,
4.3.4.2, <span class="citation" data-cites="cornford2013">(<a href="#ref-cornford2013" role="doc-biblioref">Cornford, Baines and
Wilson, 2013</a>)</span>). Supported families felt helpless and resigned
to being judged through data and sometimes suspicious of those holding
or using that data (4.3.4.1). This led in some cases to withholding of
information or distrust of support workers, harming the effectiveness of
a relationship that is designed to empower (4.4.1). In that same section
(and in <span class="citation" data-cites="bowyer2018family">(<a href="#ref-bowyer2018family" role="doc-biblioref">Bowyer <em>et
al.</em>, 2018</a>)</span> Page 7) I outline how ongoing individual
access to data has the potential to transform attitudes, remove
dependence and a feeling of being a subject, and could empower families
to help themselves. Such fears and worries about unseen data were echoed
in Case Study Two, with participants exhibiting great unawareness of
held data (Table 12, 5.3.3), and concerns over data being held out of
their sight for long periods of time (5.4.3.3) as well as similar
feelings of resignation or lack of choice (5.4.4.1, 5.6). Denying access
to held data was seen as a key source of holding power over individuals
(5.4.4.1), and visibility of data is a key part of assessing ‘to what
extent the bargain’ (of data sacrifice for value as described above) ‘is
fair’ (2.1.4, 5.5.3 and <span class="citation" data-cites="larsson2018">(<a href="#ref-larsson2018" role="doc-biblioref">Larsson, 2018</a>)</span>). It is an inherent
consequence of representing people through data and then using that data
to make decisions (2.1.2, <span class="citation" data-cites="cornford2013 bowyer2018family">(<a href="#ref-cornford2013" role="doc-biblioref">Cornford, Baines and Wilson, 2013</a>; <a href="#ref-bowyer2018family" role="doc-biblioref">Bowyer <em>et
al.</em>, 2018</a>)</span>) that individuals become sidelined and
excluded (2.3.3 and <span class="citation" data-cites="crabtree2016">(<a href="#ref-crabtree2016" role="doc-biblioref">Crabtree and Mortier,
2016</a>)</span>). Without visibility of data, consent is not
meaningful, and individual needs are more easily ignored or
overlooked.</p>

Understandable</h3>
<p><strong>Visibility and access to see data is not enough, people need
to be able to interpret it</strong>. Data is only valuable in so much as
it enables us to access the information which it encodes (2.1.1). People
need to be able to make sense of it. When humans look at data, we
inevitably attempt to interpret it to see what it can tell them; in
Early Help, support workers try to learn more about people’s lives by
examining data about them (4.2.3, 4.3.3.1). In doing so they apply their
own knowledge and expectations in an attempt to extract facts. Similarly
in the context of everyday digital life data, individuals search for
value and meaning in that data, they reflect upon it and try to relate
it to their own lives (5.4.3.1). While Early Help staff receive training
on how to understand families’ data, individuals struggle to understand
their data without sufficient support, as discussed above. Returned data
from GDPR requests is often dry and technical. It may contain codes,
internal notations or abbreviations that a layperson cannot understand
(5.4.3.1). Raw data is rarely sufficient to provide clear, unambiguous
and unbiased information to the reader <span class="citation" data-cites="gitelman2013 neff2013">(<a href="#ref-gitelman2013" role="doc-biblioref">Gitelman, 2013</a>; <a href="#ref-neff2013" role="doc-biblioref">Neff, 2013</a>)</span>. In line with one of the
three core principles of HDI, <em>legibility</em>, data should be
understandable by those it concerns <span class="citation" data-cites="mortier2014">(<a href="#ref-mortier2014" role="doc-biblioref">Mortier <em>et al.</em>, 2014</a>)</span>. In both
Case Studies (and my prior work), individuals shared a desire to not
just be aware of, but to <strong>understand</strong> what data was held
about them and how it was used (<span class="citation" data-cites="bowyer2018family">(<a href="#ref-bowyer2018family" role="doc-biblioref">Bowyer <em>et al.</em>, 2018</a>)</span>, 4.3.2.4,
5.4.2.1). People are only just beginning to understand the significance
of a data-centric world that uses data to make decisions that affect
their lives (2.1.2, 2.1.4, 5.5.3).</p>
<p><strong>People need understandable summaries of information content
and context.</strong> It was very clear from the findings of both Case
Studies that all humans looking at data need <em>summaries</em> to help
them digest and locate key information. In Case Study Two participants
were often overwhelmed or “<em>drowning”</em> (P1) at the volume or
technical complexity of the data returned from access requests, <em>“so
much of it that’s impossible to know what it all means”</em> (P4)
(5.4.3.1). These feelings were mirrored in Case Study One, by support
workers who feared the liability of having to <em>“trawl through”</em>
large volumes of data and know all the relevant and important facts
about a family so that they do not make mistakes (4.3.2.1). Participants
on both sides talked of needing help to see the whole picture, something
that is hard to achieve from individual datapoints or sets of files. In
both cases, summaries of data would help comprehension. However, the
task of creating a summary is not straightforward and places power in
the hands of the summary-maker, who can decide what is relevant, how the
data is framed and what is omitted from the summary. People look at
information for different reasons, to answer different questions, so the
question of who decides what is relevant or most important within a body
of data is a critical one. Different summaries would be needed for
different audiences. As Mortier reminds us, effective legibility
requires a recognition that individuals’ viewpoints of data can and
should differ <span class="citation" data-cites="mortier2014">(<a href="#ref-mortier2014" role="doc-biblioref">Mortier <em>et al.</em>,
2014</a>)</span>. There is a question about who decides what the viewer
of a summary ‘needs to know’ (4.3.3.1, 4.3.4.3). This is further
complicated by the fact that the data itself is not neutral <span class="citation" data-cites="gitelman2013">(<a href="#ref-gitelman2013" role="doc-biblioref">Gitelman, 2013</a>)</span>; in the Early Help
context it was clear that opinions as well as facts are recorded (<span class="citation" data-cites="bowyer2018family">(<a href="#ref-bowyer2018family" role="doc-biblioref">Bowyer <em>et
al.</em>, 2018, p. p6</a>)</span> and from SILVER project), and a focus
on the recording of data most helpful to the support worker. Commercial
data holders record data in ways that are optimised for their existing
systems and processes, as seen through the presence of internal codes,
system screenshots and filenames in returned data (5.4.3.2). In Case
Study Two most participants’ comments on returned data indicated that it
had not been not presented in a way optimised for understanding
(5.4.3.1), failing to support <em>sensemaking</em>; <em>“Information
presentation should be as clear as possible so that people can interpret
their data and extract meaningful information from it.”</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="gurstein2011">(<a href="#ref-gurstein2011" role="doc-biblioref">Gurstein, 2011</a>)</span></p>
<p><strong>Rather than raw data, people need information and
visualisations, arranged and optimised for understanding.</strong> Data,
by itself, is not meaningful. In order to be able to answer questions
and acquire knowledge, people need information (2.1.1). Access to raw
data files or database records or spreadsheets does not satisfy this,
and prior research in the civic data context states that this would be
inadequate and limiting <span class="citation" data-cites="cornford2013">(<a href="#ref-cornford2013" role="doc-biblioref">Cornford, Baines and Wilson, 2013</a>)</span>. To
comprehend the meaning of data, visualisations and explanations can help
(4.4.2); as one support worker in Case Study One observed, some families
might find data tables too technical, <em>“I think sometimes it’s easier
to do it in pictures”</em> (4.3.2.1). Participant-designed interfaces in
Case Study One included pie charts, graphs, spider diagrams and
timelines, all designed to convey information more intuitively
(4.3.2.1). In Case Study Two and prior GDPR requests, it was often the
case that companies often returned data not in understandable forms that
were less useful than the apps or websites those service providers
offer. For example, run-tracking apps such as Nike+ and Strava return
route log information in XML-based TCX files which are meaningless
without some analysis tool or visualisation. JSON files, a commonly
returned data format, often use a timestamp format that is just a long
number, not understandable by humans without extra work. Data was often
returned in formats that were more a reflection of internal systems
(e.g. screenshots, table dumps or exports) than being optimised for
understanding (5.4.3.1), which some participants found useless. As P5
observed, <em>“It’s like being given the bricks to a house… It doesn’t
really mean anything when it’s just bricks, if you don’t know how to put
it together”</em> (5.4.3.2). It is clear that visualisations are key to
accelerating understanding (and are also subject to the same challenges
of selection and bias as summaries). Furthermore, visualisations of data
can functional as powerful boundary objects and <em>“things to think
with”</em> (<span class="citation" data-cites="bowyer2018family brandt2004">(<a href="#ref-brandt2004" role="doc-biblioref">Brandt and Messeter, 2004</a>; <a href="#ref-bowyer2018family" role="doc-biblioref">Bowyer <em>et
al.</em>, 2018</a>)</span> and 3.5.2, 4.4.2) and in the care context the
use of data representations as a focal point or evidence for was thought
to be more productive and empowering (4.3.2.2, 4.4.1).</p>
<p><strong>Information becomes most meaningful when it is recognisable
and relatable and can be mapped back to life experiences.</strong>
Across both case studies, there was a clear search for meaning in data,
which manifested as a desire to use that data to build a fuller picture
of the individual (or family)‘s life. In Case Study One and in SILVER,
it was evident that support workers seek a broader view into supported
families’ lives by reviewing data about them (4.3.2, 4.3.3.1). Both
supported families and staff saw value in seeing all the data about each
individual in a common place - in other words, structuring the
information around the individual’s life, rather than the information
silos of different agencies (4.3.2.3). In Case Study Two, where
participants were asked about the value they saw in the data companies
held about them (5.3.3), it was clear that data was most valuable to
participants when it was recognisable and relatable to events in their
lives. This is particularly important for data that participants have
never seen before such as derived, acquired or metadata - without a way
to connect it to one’s own life, it is impossible to relate to (5.3.3).
Echoing goals surfaces in personal informatics literature <span class="citation" data-cites="li2010">(<a href="#ref-li2010" role="doc-biblioref">Li, Forlizzi and Dey, 2010</a>)</span>,
participants sought insights about themselves in data, and so valued
data that spanned a longer time period such that they might use it to
spot patterns in relation to events in their lives (5.4.3.1). They
valued the opportunity to use data as <em>“a window into the past”</em>
(P11, 5.4.3.1). Long term data was seen as a liability (5.4.3.3), and
when it came to considering attitudes to providers, participants were
most concerned about data collection by the larger data companies like
Google and Facebook who, through their myriad apps, websites, devices
and other means, had many touchpoints into their lives and thus had a
broader picture of their life activity (5.4.3.3. 5.4.4.2). It is clear
that to transform dry, technical data into meaningful information, it
should be contextualised in relation to events in the life of the
individual it describes.</p>
<p><strong>In practice, ongoing human support is needed to facilitate
the understanding of data.</strong> In both case studies, participants
felt that they had questions to ask of data holders, especially when the
data was difficult to understand but also more generally when the answer
to a given question could not be found in the data. In my earlier work
<span class="citation" data-cites="bowyer2018family">(<a href="#ref-bowyer2018family" role="doc-biblioref">Bowyer <em>et
al.</em>, 2018</a>)</span> and in Case Study One, participants
emphasised the ability to talk to someone about their data (4.3.2.4),
and included such features in their designs - both to understand and
receive help in understanding, but also to feedback and provide
additional information, explanation or context so that they might be
better understood (4.3.3.4). In some cases families needed additional
support for reasons of accessibility or technical literacy. Human
communication channels for data support need to be available at
convenient times too; in Case Study One individuals felt constrained by
needing to wait until their next meeting with a support worker, and
wanted a communication channel they could use in their own time. In Case
Study Two, participants were regularly frustrated by data they could not
fully understand and could not ask about: sometimes literally, when
internal codes were not explained or technical formats were used, and
sometimes when they could not understand how the information had been
derived, such as insurer’s driving scores (5.4.3.1) or Instagram’s
inferred interests. The general pattern of GDPR handling by
organisations was to deliver data, often handled by a back-end team with
no customer face or means to ask follow-up questions. Where questions
were asked they were typically hindered by delays and middlemen
preventing an effective conversation (5.3.3). Considering the systemic
changes toward data-centricity that the world has undergone, as
described in 2.1.2 and 2.2.4, it is no surprise that human support has
reduced. Across both studies we see the cost of that shift toward
dealing with data instead of dealing with people; individuals get left
behind, without the means to understand or ask about their data.</p>
<p><strong>If data is not understandable, distrust can arise.</strong>
In both Case Studies, the costs of individuals not being able to
understand their data and being left in an unsatisfactory position of
being unable to resolve concerns or ask questions is evident: Without
understanding, comes distrust. In Case Study One, participants were
concerned when they saw assertions on their records that they disputed
or could not identify the source of. In Case Study Two, privacy policies
that were too vague in their explanations of data (such as Google’s)
caused participant distrust because they seemed broad and lacked
tangible examples, and large volumes of technical data caused suspicion.
It is clear that understandable information about what is represented in
data, and about the context and use of that data, can help individuals
to trust the data holder. In the minority of cases in Case Study Two
where the GDPR had a positive impact, the reasons given included
understandable data and helpful human responses, for example P10 cited
Niantic’s detailed data and positive attitude, while P6 described
Sunderland AFC as upfront, and said that their data <em>“just made
sense”</em>. P7 specifically distrusted LinkedIn because she felt they
had not bothered to adequately engage with her (5.4.4.3). The importance
of trust will be discussed in more detail in 6.2.1 below.</p>

Useable<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></h3>
<p><strong>People need to be able to explore and interrogate data to ask
questions of it.</strong> In both case studies, many participants showed
they are aware that their personal data contains insights and value they
cannot access. In Case Study One and <span class="citation" data-cites="bowyer2018family">(<a href="#ref-bowyer2018family" role="doc-biblioref">Bowyer <em>et al.</em>, 2018</a>)</span> this
manifested as concern over what unseen incriminating judgements might be
storied in their records, and an awareness that the only data supported
families can actually see is whatever subset of data their support
worker chooses to share with them (4.3.4.1). In Case Study Two, this
manifested as feelings of not having the technical skills necessary to
explore their returned data (5.6) and that without better tools
individuals were not getting the same view of data that service provider
staff have (P2, 5.4.3.1). What we can see from these observations is
that even visible, understandable data is not enough to meet people’s
needs. People need to be able to interact with their data, in order to
explore it, gain insights or answer questions. There is a need for tools
not only to access data, but to help people make sense of (often
technically formatted) data (5.4.3.1), and explore it in different ways
to answer questions - which implies the need for operations such as
filtering, searching, comparing and orienteering (see 2.1.4 for others),
in order to understand history, context and patterns in the data, as
suggested in self informatics (SI) literature (2.2.3). Several
participants in Case Study Two hoped to receive data in formats they
could visualise, <em>“mash up”</em> and play with, but did not get this
- not only was data not optimally formatted for such use, it lacked
sufficient explanation to enable individuals to pursue such goals for
themselves (5.4.3.2).</p>
<p><strong>Data needs to be useable - correctly formatted and explained
in a portable and standardised form.</strong> As discussed in 5.6 and
5.4.3.2, people have multiple needs around data: For understanding,
people need <em>understandable information</em>, both the facts and
assertions encoded within the data, but also information about the data
itself - its context, history, use, and significance. But there is a
distinct need for <em>usable data</em>, which is somewhat orthogonal to
this. A PDF containing a screenshot from an internal system might
potentially be sufficient for understanding, but is useless for
exploration or visualisation-building. Similarly a technical log file
might contain rich data that can be queried and visualised given the
right tools, but without those tools or an informational summary, is of
no immediate value (5.4.3.2). This dilemma was alluded to by P4 in Case
Study Two thus: <em>“If you want to view the data they have about you,
it’s quite usable. If you want to do something [analytical], then it’s
not”</em> (5.4.3.2). This dichotomy of needs is discussed in 5.5.1,
where the introduction of standard formats is proposed as a means to
catalyse the building of data insight interfaces. As P1 stated, <em>“it
would be nice if these companies had a standardised model of how this
information is presented to people”</em> (5.4.3.1).</p>
<p><strong>People need to be able to interact with data, which means
interfaces are needed</strong> By themselves, even standardised files as
described above are not practically usable. As discussed in 4.4.2 and
consistent with effective access <span class="citation" data-cites="gurstein2011">(<a href="#ref-gurstein2011" role="doc-biblioref">Gurstein, 2011</a>)</span> participant data designs
in Case Study Two remind us that simply providing data is not
sufficient: to be meaningfully able to act upon data requires some form
of interface not only for visualisation and interrogation as mentioned
above, but also so that any physical, cognitive or accessibility needs
can be met. In Case Study Two, some participants wanted not just for
data access, but for tools to help them find insights from their data
(5.5.3, 5.6). While several companies are starting to create interfaces
for data access, most of these are still focussed upon file delivery,
with the notable exception of Google Timeline and Google My Activity,
which provide a glimpse how an interface to explore data could be more
useful than providing a bundle of files. Both of these examples also
re-iterate the value of unifying data around an individual’s life, as
discussed in 4.3.2.3 and above in 6.1.2 above.</p>
<p><strong>Data needs to be explorable from a temporal
perspective</strong>. Another aspect of usable data that goes beyond
what a data file can offer is the ability to view it over time. The
importance of this temporal capability, as identified in literature
cited in 2.1.4 (practical information access) and 2.2.2 (temporal PIM
systems), and my prior writing <span class="citation" data-cites="bowyer2011">(<a href="#ref-bowyer2011" role="doc-biblioref">Bowyer, 2011</a>)</span>, was evident in both Case
Studies. In SILVER and in Case Study One, being able to access
historical data for a full picture regularly surfaced as a desire in
discussions - even though the exact bounds and mechanisms for achieving
this were contentious (4.2.6, 4.3.2.1, 4.3.3.1). In Case Study Two, as
Table 12 shows, 26% of participant goals related to SI-type reflection
(2.2.3) on one’s past to enable self-insights, nostalgia and creative
uses of data. No participant was able to achieve this, and this was in
large part due to the lack of temporal data exploration capability,
meaning that significant potential value (the value of a long-term
dataset as described above) remained locked away and inaccessible (5.3,
5.6). Case Study Two also suggested a lack of thought to this temporal
perspective from data holders, who delivered data as a one-off snapshot
that was already out-of-date when delivered. Indeed the GDPR explicitly
discourages excessive data requests, rendering an ongoing view of data
as proposed in 5.5.1 near impossible. Having better temporal data
exploration capabilities would enable people to understand themselves
and their data ecosystems better, informing both personal
self-improvement goals and better decisions about personal data
practices and provider choices (5.6). Other exploration perspectives
that could be powerful include location-based views or
person/company/relationship-based views.</p>
<p><strong>People need to be able to access the valuable knowledge
locked within their data.</strong> People need to see the complete
picture of their data in order that they might access at least glean as
much value and insight from it as data holders do (5.4.3.1). For self
improvement and improving one’s situation (a key goal of Early Help),
access to metrics visible in data are extremely important, so that one
might measure progress (4.3.2.4). While support workers do endeavour to
provide this and sometime show data extracts, this can never be as
empowering as having full capabilities to explore that data <em>“in your
own time, at your own pace”</em> [<span class="citation" data-cites="bowyer2018family">Bowyer <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#ref-bowyer2018family" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>;
4.3.2.4]. In commercial service provider relationships, data interfaces
present data in ways that are configured to reflect the profit motives
of the organisation (explored further in my work with Goffe <em>et
al.</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="goffe2021">(<a href="#ref-goffe2021" role="doc-biblioref">Goffe <em>et al.</em>,
2021</a>)</span>), and so accessing a relevant view of one’s own data
and having the means to access the knowledge within it is similarly
difficult. Participants in Case Study Two found returned data unusable
(5.4.3.2), and wanted visualisations that would allow them to discover
patterns and insights, and tools to explore their data (5.4.3.1, 5.5.3).
If data holders can make data not just visible but useable, individuals
can learn about the valuable knowledge that data holders are currently
extracting from their data, and hopefully how to access that knowledge
for themselves.</p>
<p><strong>If holders do not make data usable, this is a barrier to
individual agency and power.</strong> In Human-Data Interaction terms,
people need not just legibility, but <em>agency</em> - the ability to
act upon one’s data <span class="citation" data-cites="mortier2014">(<a href="#ref-mortier2014" role="doc-biblioref">Mortier <em>et al.</em>,
2014</a>)</span>. Personal data contains valuable and actionable
information about individuals and their lives (5.5.3). The SI field has
identified that there are already many practical barriers to working
with one’s personal data effectively, including not just access but
challenges in integration, sensemaking and goal-tracking – the ‘barriers
cascade’ <span class="citation" data-cites="li2010">(<a href="#ref-li2010" role="doc-biblioref">Li, Forlizzi and Dey,
2010</a>)</span> – which hinder the ability to use one’s data for
personal benefit. As observed in Case Study Two, an inability to access
the value in your own data can lead to feelings of resignation, concern,
suspicion or distrust (5.6). Even if one can see and understand one’s
data, an inability to act upon it can reinforce feelings of being
passive and uninvolved; without this, any opportunity to feel engaged
and motivated is lost <span class="citation" data-cites="bowyer2018family">(<a href="#ref-bowyer2018family" role="doc-biblioref">Bowyer <em>et al.</em>, 2018, p. p8</a>)</span>.
Being able to use data for one’s own purposes is a critical ingredient
of empowerment and rebalancing power <span class="citation" data-cites="wef2014lens">(<a href="#ref-wef2014lens" role="doc-biblioref">Hoffman, 2014a</a>)</span>. Without data usability,

Answering RQ2: What do people want in <em>indirect</em> data
relations?</h2>
<p>By comparing and grouping elements of the findings from Case Study
One (see 4.3) and from Case Study Two (see 5.4), especially in the
context of individual relationships with care providers and digital
service providers respectively, three distinct data wants are evident
when considering <em>indirect</em> data relations:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><em>Process Transparency</em>: People need to know what data is
being collected or held, and critically how it is being used, for
accountability and safety and in order to have trust in data
holders;</li>
<li><em>Individual Oversight</em>: People need the ability to affect
what data is held and how it is used, including reacting to changing
circumstances, deleting data or withdrawing consent for certain uses;
and</li>
<li><em>Involvement in Decision-making</em>: People need to be invited
and involved in decision-making based upon their data, so that they are
not misrepresented and their needs are not overlooked. This can be aided
by collaborative use of data, giving individuals a human point of
contact, and consulting the person not just the record.</li>
</ol>
<p>These wants are detailed in the following sections:</p>
<section id="want-i1" data-number="1.2.1">
<h3 data-number="6.2.1"><span class="header-section-number">6.2.1</span>
Process Transparency</h3>
<p><strong>People need a window into how their data is used; this means
transparency of processes not just of data</strong>. It is well
established that there is currently extensive use of personal data by
service providers and other parties that is beyond an individual’s view
<span class="citation" data-cites="wef2011">(<a href="#ref-wef2011" role="doc-biblioref">Hoffman, 2011</a>)</span>, forming an ecosystem of
data use based upon one’s data, which is currently not centred on or
visible to the individual concerned (2.3.4). Decisions made based upon
personal data directly affect people’s lives through policy decisions
(in the care context) or business/functionality decisions (in the
commercial context). People need to understand the value created by the
use of their data and how (if at all) they are compensated for this
<span class="citation" data-cites="wef2011">(<a href="#ref-wef2011" role="doc-biblioref">Hoffman, 2011</a>)</span>. Even with full data
access, understanding and useability, individuals cannot see into this
opaque world of data use; the data is just an artifact produced and
shaped by unseen processes. Like an archaelogist trying to infer the
customs of lost civilisations through ancient relics, observation of the
data can only reveal so much. Andrew Cormack, writing before GDPR,
observed that <em>“it is more important to know how information is
processed than the actual values involved”</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="cormack2016">(<a href="#ref-cormack2016" role="doc-biblioref">Cormack, 2016</a>)</span>. The SILVER project found
that families had very little awareness or understanding how how their
data was used, and that consent was therefore not meaningful because
consent had been given without processual understanding [4.2.2]. In Case
Study One participants agreed that people need rights to see how their
data is used (4.2.6). Case Study Two revealed a clear desire for
awareness of how data is used, how decisions are made, and how this
might affect them (5.4.2.1), with over 74% of goals in pursuing GDPR
requests relating to wanting greater insight into personal data use
practices (5.3.2). 70% of participants wanted to understand what
providers infer from their data and this was unmet in 73% of cases and
fully met in only 7% of cases (5.3.2).</p>
<p><strong>Process transparency is required to enable
accountability.</strong> In Case Study Two, participants recognised that
organisations had collected data about them which could be exploited,
and wanted to understand the extent of that capability (5.4.3.3). Data
access can provide a window into collection capability, but only process
transparency can reveal the extent of data use capability. Many
participants expressed a desire to assess the trustworthiness of their
service providers; they had curiosity, suspicion and unanswered
questions that only transparency could address (5.3.2) and sought to
judge whether data use practices were “appropriate” (5.2.4.1). In the
Early Help context, all data processing is hidden from individual view
and no access or questioning capability except through their support
worker (functioning as a selective gatekeeper) (4.1.1, 4.2.1, 4.4.1).
Returning to Case Study Two, there was evidently some transparency
available in the form of the ability to make a GDPR request, but many
participants found GDPR responses inadequate for holding providers
accountable (5.2.4.3). Nonetheless, data access request handling is
itself a data process, and so in this sense, the GDPR process did offer
some ability to judge the trustworthiness and integrity of providers in
data handling, in part informed by the breadth and quality of data
returns (Table 11) but perhaps moreso by the experience of the GDPR
process. Many participants formed or revise their perceptions of
companies, with perceptions of providers having a lack of care and
making access difficult, or of providers being helpful and open having a
strong impact on participants’ attitudes toward them (5.4.4.3).</p>
<p><strong>There is no accountability, processes are not transparent,
and thus power remains imbalanced.</strong> Across both case studies,
the lack of process transparency is clear. Early Help services have no
obligation to describe or share their data use practices with supported
families, and apparently only even attempt to do so at the point of
initial onboarding and consent collection (<span class="citation" data-cites="bowyer2018family">Bowyer <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#ref-bowyer2018family" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>,
4.2). This equates in practice to a complete lack of accountability over
data practice (4.4.1, 4.5) Meanwhile in the commercial context, some
companies failed to respond at all to GDPR, which is a barrier to
accountability service providers. Many routinely failed to adequately
meet the transparency rights stated by GDPR, without repercussion or
consequence (5.4.2.2). In both sectors, data holders’ freedom to collect
and use data without adequate transparency or ability to be held to
account can be seen as an exertion of power over individuals. The power
imbalance (<span class="citation" data-cites="wef2011">Hoffman (<a href="#ref-wef2011" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span>, <span class="citation" data-cites="wef2014lens">Hoffman (<a href="#ref-wef2014lens" role="doc-biblioref">2014a</a>)</span>) and the
dominance of data holders over the individuals about whom data is held,
is reinforced by a lack of transparency.</p>
<p><strong>People face an incomplete picture of their data ecosystem,
even after using all available means to achieve transparency.</strong>
In SILVER and my prior work in the Early Help context, supported
families expressed concern that data could not adequately represent the
complexity of their lives (<span class="citation" data-cites="bowyer2018family">Bowyer <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#ref-bowyer2018family" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>), a
view supported by literature (<span class="citation" data-cites="cornford2013">Cornford, Baines and Wilson (<a href="#ref-cornford2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span>; <span class="citation" data-cites="gitelman2013">Gitelman (<a href="#ref-gitelman2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span>) and
sustained by support workers &amp; staff in Case Study One (4.2.6,
4.3.3.1). Therefore, transparency is vital in order to ensure data is
fair and accurate to them, yet it is not available (4.3.4.1) so they
have no means to ensure this. Similarly in Case Study Two, the most
popular GDPR goals around understanding inferences made from data about
people (5.3.3) remained unmet. Data was incomplete, delayed, or
inaccessible (5.3.2) and the potentially most informative type of data
when it comes to understanding processing – metadata, derived and
acquired data – were typically absent. Apparently broad responses were
discovered to be very limited when viewed through the lens of privacy
policy commitments and GDPR transparency rights (5.3.4).</p>
<p><strong>Trust in data holders is needed, and gaps in transparency
create distrust and a risk of broken expectations, harming
relations.</strong> Individuals need a functional understanding of their
data and its handling, and this is crucial to trust. Good explanations
(as were often found lacking in Case Study Two (5.4.3.2)) can deliver
some of this needed understanding and subsequently increase trust <span class="citation" data-cites="glavic2021">(<a href="#ref-glavic2021" role="doc-biblioref">Glavic <em>et al.</em>, 2021</a>)</span>, as
observed in a minority of cases (14%) where a good GDPR response led to
the participant’s trust in their provider increasing. Conversely we
found that incomplete data (or a general lack of
transparency/difficulties of access (5.4.4, 5.6)) can harm trust, as in
the majority of cases (52%) can harm trust (5.3.4), leading to thoughts
such as ‘what are they hiding?’ (5.4.4.3). Privacy policies that
contradicted expectations or lacked sufficient explanations also led to
distrust (5.3.4). Trust in the independence and integrity of data
holders is essential <span class="citation" data-cites="vandijck2014">(<a href="#ref-vandijck2014" role="doc-biblioref">Dijck, 2014</a>)</span>, and this was often a
concern in the Early Help context, where trust between support worker
and supported family is especially critical in order for the support
relationship to be effective. Earlier work found that families wanted to
be confident that their data would be handled sensitively and fairly
only by those with a need to know, and believed that greater visibility
of data processing would allow them to trust that that was the case
(4.2.2 and <span class="citation" data-cites="bowyer2018family">(<a href="#ref-bowyer2018family" role="doc-biblioref">Bowyer <em>et
al.</em>, 2018</a>)</span>). When families felt alienated from their
data, trust was absent (4.4.1), and a lack of transparency and
accountability makes it hard for families to maintain trust in the
system (4.5). These issues of transparency and trust are inherent in a
data-centric operating model, and the World Economic Forum have
summarised this problem thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“A crisis of trust is developing, stemming from the use of
personal data in ways that are inconsistent with individuals’
preferences or expectations.”</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="wef2014context">(<a href="#ref-wef2014context" role="doc-biblioref">Hoffman, 2014b</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Information facilitates trust; transparency therefore offers
an opportunity to earn trust &amp; improve relations.</strong> In both
studies, the findings led us to conclude that increased transparency
from data holders / service providers would improve trust; in Case Study
One we concluded that support workers and organisations should be as
open as possible about data handling and sharing (4.3.4.3), while in
Case Study Two we highlighted the potential benefits of increased
consumer loyalty that greater transparency might bring (5.5.2), as well
as the need for policymakers to legislate in favour of increasing
individuals’ understanding of data practices (5.5.1). In doing so, we
are recommending a level of transparency that goes beyond current GDPR
practice, and even beyond current GDPR policy; in order to redistribute
power, GDPR needs to deliver meaningful transparency, not just the
<em>“box ticking”</em> delivery of unhelpful files that our participants
sometimes observed (5.5.1). Crabtree describes meaningful transparency
by saying that it cannot be a <em>“one-way street”</em> that reduces
individuals to <em>“being spectators”</em> on how their data is used; he
says that it involves <em>“making the whole ecosystem transparent, not
just the front end”</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="crabtree2016">(<a href="#ref-crabtree2016" role="doc-biblioref">Crabtree and Mortier, 2016</a>)</span>. Access to
good information about practices is the most effective way to earn trust
(5.4.4.2), and both studies’ findings suggest that a proactive attitude
can do just that. (4.4.1, 4.3.4.2, 5.5.2, 5.6).</p>
<p><strong>Initially, transparency may cause distrust, but only where
practice is problematic; this is accountability becoming real and
catalysing better data practices.</strong> It is important to note that
in Case Study Two we saw the transparency of GDPR cause elevated
distrust (5.3.4), however this does not mean it should be avoided. The
reasons cited for distrust arising were invariably due to the discovery
of practices that participants did not approve of. This is a clear
illustration of the link between transparency and accountability; the
transparency reveals the non-consensual or unsatisfactory practices that
providers must change if they wish to maintain trust and loyalty, such
as unclear data practices, data over-use or data sharing that the
individual would not have consented to had they been asked. This shows
that in some cases trust is fragile, where unfavourable practices are
hidden and only the individual’s unawareness is keeping the relationship
intact (5.4.4). Data holders should not only be transparent, but should
follow this up by acting upon subsequent feedback, improving practices
that individuals discover and challenge (5.4.4.3). By shining a light,
accountability becomes real and change for the better can occur.
Ultimately, increasing transparency can help providers uncover exactly
what they need to do to earn greater trust (5.6).</p>
<p><strong>Without transparency of data and processes, individual action
is blocked and power remains imbalanced.</strong> Across the two
studies, a clear pattern emerges: transparency can increase trust,
enable accountability, empower individuals, and (provided organisations
respond favourably) actually tilt the power balance back toward an
equitable and fair relationship where data is collected and used in
clear sight of the individuals it concerns, where they might hold those
organisations to account and immediately challenge any unsatisfactory
practice, unauthorised processing/sharing or inaccurate data. Thanks to
GDPR, individuals are now able to take direct action to educate
themselves and pursue greater transparency, and utilise their rights to
motivate incremental changes from data holders (5.5.3). Without
transparency, data holders will continue to hold the balance of power,
and individuals will lack agency and accountability.</p>

Individual Oversight</h3>
<p><strong>Data visibility and process transparency naturally leads to a
desire for individual oversight.</strong> If you see something that is
‘not right’, you are motivated to want to fix it. And therefore, people
want something more than data and process transparency, the natural next
step is the ability to make decisions about what happens to their data.
Participants’ goals in Case Study Two included curiosity, suspicion and
a desire to shed light on specific incidents (5.3.3), mirroring the
desires families in <span class="citation" data-cites="bowyer2018family">(<a href="#ref-bowyer2018family" role="doc-biblioref">Bowyer <em>et al.</em>, 2018</a>)</span> exhibited
to be able to know and see what data was held and used about them. In
both cases, individuals wanted to have a say over what happens. Current
models of informed consent have been found to be inadequate, with the
initial handover of data acting as a <em>‘point of severance’</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="luger2013">(<a href="#ref-luger2013" role="doc-biblioref">Luger and Rodden, 2013</a>)</span>. This was echoed
in the experiences of families in the Early Help context, who gave
consent at the point of initial onboarding, but lost all ability to
influence what happens to their data thereafter [<span class="citation" data-cites="bowyer2018family">Bowyer <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#ref-bowyer2018family" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>;
4.2.2]. GDPR aims to adhere more to a <em>dynamic consent</em> model
<span class="citation" data-cites="kaye2015 williams2015">(<a href="#ref-kaye2015" role="doc-biblioref">Kaye <em>et al.</em>,
2015</a>; <a href="#ref-williams2015" role="doc-biblioref">Williams
<em>et al.</em>, 2015</a>)</span> by giving people an ongoing set of
rights, including the right to be informed about the use of your data,
the right to object to certain data uses, and the right to get your data
corrected or deleted <span class="citation" data-cites="ico2018">(<a href="#ref-ico2018" role="doc-biblioref">Information Commissioner’s
Office, 2018</a>)</span>. In line with the <em>accountability
principle</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="ec2010accountability crabtree2016">(<a href="#ref-ec2010accountability" role="doc-biblioref">Article 29 Data
Protection Working Party, 2010</a>; <a href="#ref-crabtree2016" role="doc-biblioref">Crabtree and Mortier, 2016</a>)</span>, this in
effect would allow people to act as overseers or regulators over their
own data: watching how it is used, and demanding action or change to
practice when they see data use that goes against their wishes.</p>
<p><strong>People need agency and negotiability over held data about
them, in order to ensure fairness and accuracy and reduce risk.</strong>
As my earlier work in the Early Help context <span class="citation" data-cites="bowyer2018family">(<a href="#ref-bowyer2018family" role="doc-biblioref">Bowyer <em>et al.</em>, 2018</a>)</span> showed,
there is a strong desire to ensure data is <em>fair</em> and
<em>accurate</em>, because that data is used to inform judgements and
make decisions that can directly affect the individuals concerned. Data
in Case Study Two showed a clear problem with the accuracy of unseen
data: while in 92% of cases volunteered data (which by definition, has
been seen by the individual) was found accurate, derived and acquired
data (previously unseen by the individual) was found inaccurate in 50%
and 80% of cases respectively (5.3.2). Being able to ensure fair and
accurate data goes beyond being able to see and understand the data, but
requires also <em>agency</em> (the ability to act within a data system,
such as to delete or correct data, or withdraw consent) and
<em>negotiability</em> (the ability to continue to have a voice and make
changes as circumstances change) <span class="citation" data-cites="mortier2014">(<a href="#ref-mortier2014" role="doc-biblioref">Mortier <em>et al.</em>, 2014</a>)</span>. People
need a relationship with their data (2.1.5). In both Case Studies and in
earlier work, individuals perceived tangible risks both of data being
held beyond their reach, but also of potentially inaccurate data being
used to make decisions. Risk factors identified in the Early Help
context included facilitating or encouraging crime, causing social and
psychological harm, and enabling medical mismanagement or welfare
support failures <span class="citation" data-cites="bowyer2018family">(<a href="#ref-bowyer2018family" role="doc-biblioref">Bowyer <em>et al.</em>, 2018</a>)</span>. In Case
Study Two, participants felt that held data about them that is not
visible or controllable was a liability that might lead to privacy
violations, commercial exploitation, and an increased risk of data leaks
(5.4.3.3). Clearly people feel that for their data to be safe, they must
be able to see and verify its storage and use for themselves and enforce
action when something is not right. As early as 1980, when the world was
less data-centric, it was already recognised that individuals would need
the ability to challenge data use, as the OECD observed in their
guidelines:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“The right of individuals to access and challenge personal data
is generally regarded as perhaps the most important privacy protection
safeguard.”</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="OECD1980">(<a href="#ref-OECD1980" role="doc-biblioref">Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development, 1980</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Individual oversight capabilities must be supported by
governance, so that individuals can effect desired changes.</strong> As
Gurstein notes, a key element of effective data access is governance,
that is, mandating data holders to support individuals in accessing
their data and respecting their wishes over what should happen to that
data <span class="citation" data-cites="gurstein2011">(<a href="#ref-gurstein2011" role="doc-biblioref">Gurstein,
2011</a>)</span>. Individuals need be be able to give instructions, make
changes and express permissions that have weight; they need to be
listened to, so that they can meaningfully effect change (4.4.2).
Bakardjieva, examining the use of data about others in a different
context (research), identified that individuals whose data is used need
the ability to influence not only the data about them, but the actual
decision-making that occurs based on that data: both the data
<em>and</em> the decision-making should become objects that the
individual subject can manipulate <span class="citation" data-cites="bakardjieva2001">(<a href="#ref-bakardjieva2001" role="doc-biblioref">Bakardjieva and Feenberg, 2001</a>)</span>. At the
time of writing (March 2022), much of the focus on GDPR has been about
access to data, perhaps because this is more tangible, and very little
about GDPR’s other rights that can influence decision-making (5.1.2).
This was backed up by participant experiences in Case Study Two, where
desires to influence or change practices or delete data were either not
actionable or ineffective (5.4.3.3). Governance over individual data
rights has two elements. First, to support individuals in complaints or
challenges, which are currently unevenly enforced (5.5.1). But more
importantly than this, given the extensive use of data by organisations
and the great potential for misuse or harm, individuals need to be able
to trust that systems are in place that mandate the behaviour of data
holders to be trustworthy; to compel organisations to maintain good data
practices such as data security and dynamic consent in the first place
(5.4.4.1). In the GDPR context bodies that can do this already exist -
the Data Protection Authorities. In the public sector/care context, the
picture is less clear. Participants identified a need for oversight
bodies to compel good practice, identify appropriate access rules, and
to provide independent oversight in contentious cases (4.3.4.3); this is
particularly difficult given that no organisation can see the full
picture of an individual’s civic data.</p>
<p><strong>Individual oversight would bring individuals back to the
centre of their personal data ecosystem as an active
participant.</strong> As outlined in 2.3.4, the ideal has been
established that individuals need to be at the centre of their own
personal data ecosystem, overseeing and controlling their data selves as
easily as their physical selves. Currently, as seen in both contexts,
data functions as a proxy for their direct involvement [<span class="citation" data-cites="bowyer2018family">Bowyer <em>et al.</em>
(<a href="#ref-bowyer2018family" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>;
5.4.4.1]. Decisionmakers consult data first, as the primary source of
truth (4.1.2, 2.1.2), and the individual second (if at all). For
transparency to be meaningful, data flows need to open up to include
individuals as part of the loop, changing them from passive spectators
to active participants <span class="citation" data-cites="wef2014lens crabtree2016">(<a href="#ref-wef2014lens" role="doc-biblioref">Hoffman, 2014a</a>; <a href="#ref-crabtree2016" role="doc-biblioref">Crabtree and Mortier, 2016</a>)</span> in the
processing of their data. Examples of specific oversight abilities
desired in Case Study One were the ability to explain or annotate
datapoints (4.3.3.4), to be able to check data together with support
workers, with the record of that check becoming part of the data
(4.3.3.2), or to have granular access controls over precisely which data
could be seen by whom (4.3.3.5). In Case Study Two, a clear picture
emerged that what participants want is the ability to make choices. They
want control over the data they are forced to sacrifice to companies
(5.4.4.1); to avoid the <em>‘point of severance’</em> Luger describes,
data sacrifice should be a loan or sublicense, not a
taking-possession-of.</p>
<p><strong>Given the changing and complex nature of human life, data is
inadequate and consent is never complete, so longitudinal participation
and oversight is needed.</strong> Too often, data is treated as a static
source of truth (see above). Attempting to represent people as data in
order to require less human contact is a reasonable goal from an
organisational efficiency or cost-saving perspective, but any
representation will never be complete or adequate <span class="citation" data-cites="cornford2013 bowyer2018family">(<a href="#ref-cornford2013" role="doc-biblioref">Cornford, Baines and Wilson, 2013</a>; <a href="#ref-bowyer2018family" role="doc-biblioref">Bowyer <em>et
al.</em>, 2018</a>)</span>. In Case Study One, the findings showed the
need for numerous efforts to augment data in order to combat its
inherent inadequacy, such as support workers seeking to understand the
people behind the records (4.3.3.1) and maintaining a constant attitude
of seeking to understand more deeply than the data record can allow
(4.3.4.2). Even if a data record can be corrected or completed, it will
still be inadequate, because human lives change continuously: people
move, start and end relationships and jobs, marry, divorce, have
children, pursue new interests, become incapacitated, or die. The
passage of time can radically change the context or relevance of data
<span class="citation" data-cites="bowyer2018family">(<a href="#ref-bowyer2018family" role="doc-biblioref">Bowyer <em>et
al.</em>, 2018</a>)</span>. A one-time informed consent upon data
collection is inadequate in this ever-changing context (4.2.2, 4.2.6,
4.3.3.3). And of course, if consent needs to be ongoing (and in order
for it to be meaningful) this means that engagement with the individual
concerned, and that individual having a view of their data and its use,
need to be ongoing too. In order to avoid storing or using data beyond
its need, ongoing data access is needed, in order to enable ongoing
individual oversight (4.2.2, 4.3.2.4). Systems and processes must treat
data as dynamic (4.3.3.3), as something that will become inaccurate
without sustained engagement. In Case Study Two, we note that GDPR data
access is currently based around viewing a one-time snapshot of your
data, and does not take this need for negotiability <span class="citation" data-cites="mortier2014">(<a href="#ref-mortier2014" role="doc-biblioref">Mortier <em>et al.</em>, 2014</a>)</span> into
account at all (5.5.1) (though some companies now offer download
dashboards that come closer to providing ongoing access). Ongoing
access, consent and participation do carry cost implications for
providers, and effort implications for individuals - but these can be
improved over time: the former through automation, standards and
education, and the latter through holistic approaches to personal data
ecosystems; these mitigations will be explored further in Chapter 7.</p>
<p><strong>There is scant individual oversight available today.
Governance is lacking. If people cannot make choices about their data,
they will remain powerless.</strong> Participants in both contexts faced
an inability to see the full picture of how their data is processed and
used. Despite families in Case Study One workshops spending time
designing interfaces for seeing and correcting their data and changing
permissions (3.5.3, 4.3.2.1, 4.3.2.3), no such interfaces exist. The
entirety of their data access and influence is limited to what can be
achieved verbally with their support workers (4.2.4, 4.4.3). Without
transparency and dynamic consent mechanisms, those families lack
accountability. They are excluded with no ability to oversee or
participate in the life of their data. In Case Study Two, of the 41% of
participant goals that concerned gaining insight into and control over
the use of their data, 66% were unmet. Participants reported seeing no
clear pathway on how to access rights to control their data and only 1
of the 10 cases where a participant wanted to delete their data was
successful (5.3.3). At the time of writing only one company, Apple, has
a privacy hub that offers clear routes to access data rights other than
access. Participants also reported in some cases being unable to check
the accuracy of their data, or to investigate specific incidents where
they had concerns (5.3.3). The general view was one of widespread
disappointment, that despite the promise of GDPR it did not confer any
power to the individual to influence data use. (5.2.4.3), leading in
some cases to a reluctance to submit GDPR requests in future. Access
requests were also rarely seen as useful in the care context, and our
understanding is they typically only occur in the case of complaints. In
the GDPR context, the inability to restrict data use or delete data was
seen as a lack of control, and the retaining of data against their
wishes as a liability (5.4.3.3). Ultimately oversight means having
choices, which is essential in the data-centric world. The case studies’
findings show that, in general, participants felt they had been forced
to sacrifice data to access services, and offered <em>no</em> practical
choices or control over that data. Without individual oversight, there
is no choice and people remain powerless.</p>

Decision-making Involvement</h3>
<p><strong>Data represents people. But people are more than can be
encapsulated in records. There is a need to engage the human behind the
data, as people can never be fully represented in data.</strong>
Intrinsic in the move towards data-centricity has been a move away from
human involvement. In the commercial sector this is due to cost-saving
(call centres and web portals being cheaper than individual customer
interactions) (2.1.2). In the care context it is similar but there is
also a desire to create a society that functions at large without
individuals requiring special handling and support (3.4.1). Both case
studies’ findings, consistent with literature <span class="citation" data-cites="abiteboul2015 crabtree2016">(<a href="#ref-abiteboul2015" role="doc-biblioref">Abiteboul, André and Kaplan, 2015</a>; <a href="#ref-crabtree2016" role="doc-biblioref">Crabtree and Mortier,
2016</a>)</span>, reveal myriad problems created by the exclusion <span class="citation" data-cites="bowyer2018family">(<a href="#ref-bowyer2018family" role="doc-biblioref">Bowyer <em>et
al.</em>, 2018</a>)</span> of people from matters that affect them -
from feelings of alienation or disengagement (5.4.4.1) to actual harms
caused by erroneous or unfair judgements (4.2.2). Service providers
holding data need to contextualise data as an incomplete view into the
complex human world, and seek greater understanding (4.3.4.2) while
looking for positives in data (4.3.4.1). It is interesting to note that
the Troubled Families programme was created help find the human
situations of people slipping through the cracks of the system, which
highlights the inadequacy of purely data-based decision-making
(3.4.1).</p>
<p><strong>Consent to access and use data needs to be dynamic and
meaningful, which can only happen through ongoing involvement.</strong>
As established in 4.4.1 and above in 6.2.2, ongoing data consent is
essential, and this is especially important where that data is used to
make decisions (4.4.3). One-time consent is ineffective and meaningless
(4.5). Asking individuals for consent and subsequently less involved in
decision-making reinforces a hierarchical, rather than an equitable,
power relationship, as Bakardjieva and Feenberg found in their work
looking at how to involve virtual subjects in research <span class="citation" data-cites="bakardjieva2001">(<a href="#ref-bakardjieva2001" role="doc-biblioref">Bakardjieva and
Feenberg, 2001</a>)</span>. Without ongoing consent, the power imbalance
is amplified (4.5). In the commercial context, companies view data as
their asset to exploit <span class="citation" data-cites="wef2011 toonders2014">(<a href="#ref-wef2011" role="doc-biblioref">Hoffman, 2011</a>; <a href="#ref-toonders2014" role="doc-biblioref">Toonders, 2014</a>)</span>, and the simple fact of
having the ability to collect or access to data about people has proved
in practice, sufficient to enable a variety of practices which would be
likely to be refused consent if made visible to users <span class="citation" data-cites="evans2021 claburn2021 melendez2019">(<a href="#ref-melendez2019" role="doc-biblioref">Melendez and Pasternack,

<a href="#ref-claburn2021" role="doc-biblioref">Claburn,
2021</a>)</span>. Individuals feel forced into a one-sided arrangement
of sacrificing data in exchange for service benefits; with no choice
upfront on signup, and minimal practical choices afterwards, their only
choice is Hobson’s choice <span class="citation" data-cites="britannicaHobsonsChoice">(<a href="#ref-britannicaHobsonsChoice" role="doc-biblioref"><span>‘<span class="nocase">Hobson’s Choice</span>’</span>, no date</a>)</span>.
Consent has become commoditised, and from a corporate perspective the
focus has become constructing a legal justification for using an
individual’s data rather than practically engaging with them and
verifying if they approve <span class="citation" data-cites="woods2022">(<a href="#ref-woods2022" role="doc-biblioref">Woods and Böhme, 2022</a>)</span>. This can only
happen when the individual about which data is held is excluded from
data handling processes.</p>
<p><strong>A human channel for conversation is wanted, to enable
explanations, questions, and consultation</strong>. In my earlier work
<span class="citation" data-cites="bowyer2018family">(<a href="#ref-bowyer2018family" role="doc-biblioref">Bowyer <em>et
al.</em>, 2018</a>)</span> and in Case Study One, all participants
viewed that individuals should be able to talk to someone about their
data (4.2.6, 4.3.2.4), in order to ask questions or explain datapoints.
In Case Study Two, participants had questions about their data that they
wanted to answer (5.3.3), yet these questions remained unanswered
(5.4.2.3). Participants regularly experienced painful and ineffective
processes when trying to answer their questions, found that GDPR
responses, often unhelpful, provided no backchannel for followup
questions or further communication (5.2.4.3). They were left <em>‘in the
dark’</em>. This highlights the need for a human support channel, which
is not mandated by GDPR, not just to better understand the data itself
(6.1.2), but to enable ongoing consent negotiation within the
relationship with data holders.</p>
<p><strong>Individuals should be consulted in decision-making. This
improves accuracy, perspective, and fairness and reduces consent
liability.</strong> A common theme in the findings of both my earlier
work with families and Case Study One was the idea that data is more
likely to be fair and accurate if in the individual has the opportunity
to express their perspective on it. Families advocated checking data
together to identify gaps (4.3.3.2), valued the prospect of making their
own contributions to the data to <em>‘tell their own story’</em>
(4.3.3.4) and wanted a <em>‘right to explain’</em> or annotate their
data <span class="citation" data-cites="bowyer2018family">(<a href="#ref-bowyer2018family" role="doc-biblioref">Bowyer <em>et
al.</em>, 2018</a>)</span>. Support workers recognised the need to work
with families to understand their situation better (4.3.2.2). These
findings show it is important to give the human data subject a role in
data creation or checking, and that if they are involved involved, to
ensure a fairer and more complete view can be obtained than the limited
view presented by the data record (4.3.3.1). Without involvement, agency
<span class="citation" data-cites="mortier2014">(<a href="#ref-mortier2014" role="doc-biblioref">Mortier <em>et al.</em>,
2014</a>)</span> will always be limited. Data is not neutral <span class="citation" data-cites="gitelman2013 neff2013">(<a href="#ref-gitelman2013" role="doc-biblioref">Gitelman, 2013</a>; <a href="#ref-neff2013" role="doc-biblioref">Neff, 2013</a>)</span>, and
this means all stakeholders should be given a role <span class="citation" data-cites="bowker2005">(<a href="#ref-bowker2005" role="doc-biblioref">Bowker, 2005</a>)</span> in order to avoid errors,
harm or disempowerment (4.4.1). While involvement is neglible in the
care context (being limited to the TAF and the support worker
relationship, in the commercial context, there is no such involvement,
and the results of this can be seen in the low accuracy of previously
unseen data (5.3.3) and in the low trust ratings (5.3.4) given to many
providers after seeing data returns. It seems that data and knowledge
would become more accurate when it is closer the data is to the
individuals concerned (4.4.3, 4.5); data created and handled far from
the family would intuitively be less accurate and less likely to have
been considered from their perspective (4.2.2). Organisations on both
sides value data accuracy (4.2.3, 2.1.2) so greater involvement could
help achieve this. Data holders would also benefit from involving
individuals because responsibility for consent would become shared,
resulting in a higher ‘buy-in’ from individuals and a reduced liability;
provided communication is effective and without barriers, involved
individuals would be inclined to speak up if they see something they do
not agree with (4.4.1). Of course, this call for involvement in
decision-making is not absolute. Businesses need to be free to exercise
their expertise. Patients are not best placed to decide what medicines
they need, and over-involvement of users in product design can result in
mediocre products that suffer from <em>‘design by committee’</em>. In
fact, the attitude conveyed toward the individual is critical (as borne
out in our Case Study Two findings (5.4.4.2, 5.4.4.3); Edwards and
Elwyn, in their paper on shared decision-making, argue that
<em>feeling</em> involved is actually more important that actually
contributing to decisions <span class="citation" data-cites="edwards2006">(<a href="#ref-edwards2006" role="doc-biblioref">Edwards and Elwyn, 2006</a>)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Effective collaboration can be achieved by coming together
around the data, using it as evidence (of facts or of opinions) and as a
boundary object.</strong> Workshop C in Case Study One specifically
explored the prospects of shared data interaction, which had emerged
from SILVER and phase 1 (Workshop A/B, see 4.2.5) findings as a possible
way to meet the needs of both supported families and support workers.
Shared values were identified (4.2.6) and a model for shared data
interaction builds upon the findings (4.4.3). Central to this is the
idea that evidence-based decision-making can be more effective (both
from a rapport-building perspective but also in terms of the quality of
decision made) as guidance has advised [<span class="citation" data-cites="ofsted2015">OFSTED (<a href="#ref-ofsted2015" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span>; <span class="citation" data-cites="dfe2018">Department for Education (<a href="#ref-dfe2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>;4.1.2] and as seen in the findings
(4.3.2.2, 4.3.3, 4.4.1). Families and staff saw potential benefits from
checking data together (4.3.3.2), using specific datapoints in
discussions as evidence (4.3.2.2), or to help families open up (4.4.2),
on top of the simple benefits of making all evidence equally visible
(4.3.2.2, 6.1.1). Throughout such shared data interactions,
representations of data perform an important function as a boundary
object <span class="citation" data-cites="star2010 bowker2016">(<a href="#ref-star2010" role="doc-biblioref">Star, 2010</a>; <a href="#ref-bowker2016" role="doc-biblioref">Bowker <em>et al.</em>,

relatable to both parties, <em>“things to think with”</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="papert1980 brandt2004">(<a href="#ref-papert1980" role="doc-biblioref">Papert, 1980</a>; <a href="#ref-brandt2004" role="doc-biblioref">Brandt and Messeter,

(perfectly valid) differences in different parties’ perspectives <span class="citation" data-cites="mortier2014">(6.1.2, <a href="#ref-mortier2014" role="doc-biblioref">Mortier <em>et al.</em>,
2014</a>)</span>. Working with families in 2017 I observed that
gathering around data representations facilitated a less confrontational
interaction than an across-the-table interview would <span class="citation" data-cites="bowyer2018family">(<a href="#ref-bowyer2018family" role="doc-biblioref">Bowyer <em>et
al.</em>, 2018</a>)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Being involved means being able to learn and take action at
any time, including on one’s own and away from official contact or
interactions with service representatives.</strong> Both Case Studies
reveal that people want an ongoing window into their data and its use.
Limiting data access and process transparency to specific times spent
with a gatekeeper, as in the Early Help case (4.1.1), or to a process
that only provides a one-time snapshot of data (5.5.1) reinforces the
hierarchical power imbalance. Giving access to data and abilities to
explore and ask questions <em>“in your own time”</em> (4.3.2.4) can
unlock new individual benefits from data (5.4.3.2, 6.1.3) and provide
more immediate feedback that can help people measure their progress
towards improvement goals (2.2.3, 4.4.2, 4.4.3), as well as enabling
ongoing individual oversight (4.4.2) and dynamic consent (4.3.4.3). In
the face of providers making decisions based on unseen data using
processes that cannot be observed, people feel excluded and powerless
(5.4.4.1, 6.1.1). To ensure effective access <span class="citation" data-cites="gurstein2011">(<a href="#ref-gurstein2011" role="doc-biblioref">Gurstein, 2011</a>)</span>, accountability and
trust, there must be ongoing involvement, data access and transparency
(5.5.1, 6.2.2).</p>
<p><strong>Indirect data use enforces an uneasy trust; services that use
data need a human face or point of contact, in order to grow
understanding, earn trust and improve relations.</strong> There is a
coldness to data. Facts, judgments and mistakes appear in print with
equal weight, without explanation or context, seemingly a complete set
of objective facts. In both studies, the value of human contact
accompanying data access was evident; in Case Study Two participants
valued the GDPR responses that felt most human (5.4.4.3) and lamented
the inability to discuss data or resolve questions (5.3.3, 5.4.2.3). In
<span class="citation" data-cites="bowyer2018family">(<a href="#ref-bowyer2018family" role="doc-biblioref">Bowyer <em>et
al.</em>, 2018</a>)</span> participants wanted <em>‘to have a
conversation’</em> about their data and in Case Study One participant
data interface designs included buttons to chat to their support worker
or ask questions (4.3.2.3). People do not want to be severed or
alienated from their data, yet they feel they have no choice but to
relinquish access and involvement (4.4.2, 5.4.4.1). Ideally, all
data-using organisations would have a human face or point of contact
that individuals can address questions to and in whom their trust of the
organisation can be embodied (4.4.2).</p>
<p><strong>Without involvement, people cannot take a full and equitable
role in processes that affect their life.</strong> When data is used by
organisations, this inherently serves as a proxy for their involvement
[<span class="citation" data-cites="bowyer2018family">Bowyer <em>et
al.</em> (<a href="#ref-bowyer2018family" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>; 5.4.4.1]. People have
consequently lost control and agency <span class="citation" data-cites="crabtree2016">(<a href="#ref-crabtree2016" role="doc-biblioref">Crabtree and Mortier, 2016</a>)</span>, creating a
crisis of trust and a power imbalance <span class="citation" data-cites="wef2014lens wef2014context">(<a href="#ref-wef2014lens" role="doc-biblioref">Hoffman, 2014a</a>, <a href="#ref-wef2014context" role="doc-biblioref">2014b</a>)</span>. Exclusion from data handling and
decision-making inevitably reinforces a hierarchy, with the individual
destined to have less say and influence over services that affect their
daily lives. Taken together, an ongoing involvement with the data held
by service providers and the processes that use that data would change
indirect data interaction (6.2) into direct data interaction (6.1) and
transform the individual experience of service use. Of course such a
shift is difficult and constly to offer, for both small and large
companies – the data-centric world emerged in part as a means to reduce
costly human interactions and facilitate large-scale scaling up to serve
larger user bases – but what we see suggests that the balance has tipped
too far towards exclusion of individuals, and that giving them even a
limited role in reviewing data, consenting and contributing to
decisions, and just being informed, could carry significant benefits for
both individual empowerment and organisational reputation, and
trust.</p>

Summation: Six Wants That Would Empower Individuals with Better HDR</h2>
<p>In this chapter, the separate Case Study findings and insights from
Chapters <a href="#chapter-4">4</a> and <a href="#chapter-5">5</a> have
been synthesised to identify six specific capabilities that people need
in their relationship with their personal data - both from the direct
perspective of <a href="#RQ1">RQ1</a>, where people want for
<strong>visible, understandable and useable<sup><a href="#fn15">15</a></sup> data</strong>, and from the indirect
perspective of <a href="#RQ2">RQ2</a>, where people want for
<strong>process transparency, individual oversight and decision-making
involvement</strong>.</p>
<p>In line with the pragmatist, individualist outlook of this thesis [<a href="#3.1">3.1</a>], these six wants amount to <strong>a desire for
empowerment</strong>, motivated by a desire to pursue one’s own
happiness and self-interest. Empowerment is defined as <em>“the process
of gaining freedom and power to do what you want or to control what
happens to you”</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="dictEmpowerment">(<a href="#ref-dictEmpowerment" role="doc-biblioref">Cambridge Dictionary, no date</a>)</span>. In
essence, empowerment is achieved when the individual, in consideration
of the question <em>“what can I do?”</em>, judges that they can do more.
Power, it transpires, is a double-edged concept. The power imbalance
over personal data [<a href="#2.1.2">2.1.2</a>] encompasses both
<em>‘power to’</em> but also the concept of <em>‘power over’</em>. These
are best considered as two sides of the same coin or two perspectives on
the same set of facts: organisations have <em>‘social power’</em> over
individuals, that affects what both parties can do. An organisation
having social power does not imply a desire to dominate; impacts on the
individual’s agency are merely material effects of the power holder’s
attempts to influence the behaviour of individuals in pursuit of the
power holder’s own desired outcomes <span class="citation" data-cites="pansardi2012">(<a href="#ref-pansardi2012" role="doc-biblioref">Pansardi, 2012</a>)</span>. Concepts of power are
explored further in <a href="#7.3.4.1">7.3.4.1</a>.</p>
<p>Not only do these six wants lead to individual empowerment, there is
a clear correlation. <strong>The more that the six data wants can be
addressed, the more empowering it is to individuals.</strong> From the
case studies it is clear that the status quo of the data-centric world
(2.1) is that lack of these six capabilities reduces individual capacity
to act, individuals are <strong>disempowered</strong>. People are
treated indirectly through data <span class="citation" data-cites="cornford2013">(<a href="#ref-cornford2013" role="doc-biblioref">Cornford, Baines and Wilson, 2013</a>)</span>; they
are excluded and not involved [<a href="#4.5">4.5</a>, <a href="#5.4.2.1">5.4.2.1</a>, <a href="#5.4.3.3">5.4.3.3</a>, <a href="#5.4.4.1">5.4.4.1</a>]. While in both Case Studies many of the
findings are based on the <em>opinions</em> of participants as to what
they believe <em>would</em> be desirable, preferable or more successful,
in the case of data visibility [<a href="#6.1.3">6.1.3</a>] and process
transparency [<a href="#6.2.1">6.2.1</a>] there is clear evidence that
it <em>does</em> have an impact on individual’s subjective assessment of
their own empowerment: In Case Study Two, 45% of cases saw people
experience a change in power after examining privacy policies and
scrutinising GDPR responses. 29% felt a decrease in power, and 17% an
increase. Data visibility and process transparency seem to be key first
steps towards empowerment, as they allow a more accurate assessment of
one’s own capability. In 52% of cases Case Study Two participants felt
more distrustful, having discovered unsatisfactory exertions of power by
providers [<a href="#5.3.4">5.3.4</a>]. Once visibility and transparency
have been achieved, it is clear that this should be followed soon after
with understanding [<a href="#6.1.1">6.1.1</a>], agency [<a href="#6.1.3">6.1.3</a>, <a href="#6.2.2">6.2.2</a>] and involvement [<a href="#6.2.3">6.2.3</a>]. Any one of the six wants can improve HDR for
the individual, but the combination of all six is likely to produce more
than the sum of its parts – <strong>an empowered digital
citizen</strong>.</p>
<p>Considering the societal level, these six wants show <strong>how
society should be reconfigured to improve HDR</strong>. Giving people a
role in influencing the life of their own data is a key ingredient in
and of more progressive digital citizenship <span class="citation" data-cites="bridle2016">(<a href="#ref-bridle2016" role="doc-biblioref">Bridle, 2016</a>)</span>. Shifting data interaction
interfaces and processes to a more human-centric [<a href="#2.3">2.3</a>] model where people are controllers at the centre of
their own personal data ecosystem [<a href="#2.3.4">2.3.4</a>] would be
progressive and transformative, and not without cost, education,
deployment and uptake challenges. Nonetheless participants in both
studies could easily imagine more human-centric interfaces and more
empowering service interactions and demanded those improvements. And it
is possible; just as some human-centric practices were beginning to
emerge among support services in Case Study One [<a href="#4.3.1">4.3.1</a>], so some companies targeted in Case Study Two
are already beginning to move in this direction: some offer privacy hubs
and explanations of data practices, while others offer interfaces solely
for accessing data and exerting data rights [<a href="#5.1.1">5.1.1</a>]. In both Case Studies there was a clear demand
for this initial forays by service providers to be expanded: be it
through more pro-active data practices in the care context [<a href="#4.3.4.3">4.3.4.3</a>], or new models of data involvement in the
commercial context [<a href="#5.5.2">5.5.2</a>]. If the locus of
decision-making [<a href="#4.4.3">4.4.3</a>] could be shifted towards
individuals through such reconfigurations of existing practices, this
would give them a role to play as agents in the life of their data,
allowing them to curate their own data self, the representation of them
used in decisionmaking, so that it is fair, accurate and representative
[<span class="citation" data-cites="bowyer2018family">Bowyer <em>et
al.</em> (<a href="#ref-bowyer2018family" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>; [<a href="#4.4.3">4.4.3</a>]. The
principles of involvement, effective access and shared data interaction
could be applied in many domains - education, health, democracy and
commerce, and an emphasis on individual sociotechnical capabilities is a
useful mindset to apply to both business process design and data
interface design.</p>
<p><strong>Empowering individuals with better HDR should lead to a
better future.</strong> Taken together, the pursuit of the six data
wants allow us to envisage a new, fully data-empowered future for
individuals, who would reap the benefits of being able to gain insights
and feedback from their own data in real time, while also co-operating
with service providers in the stewardship of their data and involved in
decisions. They would have agency, influence and negotiability in an
ongoing manner. In this future, there are opportunities for
organisations to reimagine customer relations and the role of data in
service provision, leading to increased accuracy and consent, reduced
liability, greater trust and loyalty [<a href="#5.5.2">5.5.2</a>], and
potentially to capitalise on new demands for data insight tools [<a href="#5.5.3">5.5.3</a>]. The ideal is that individuals would have a
<em>“permanently open two-way communication channel [with data holders],
allowing a dialogue to take place”</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="bakardjieva2001">(<a href="#ref-bakardjieva2001" role="doc-biblioref">Bakardjieva and Feenberg, 2001</a>)</span>,
delivering dynamic consent and ongoing involvement. Such a change in
thinking, away from legal box-ticking (be it capturing informed consent
[<a href="#4.1.2">4.1.2</a>], or satisfying GDPR requests [<a href="#5.5.1">5.5.1</a>]) and towards delivering an ongoing
understanding of the collection and use of one’s data and a voice in
what happens to it, would empower individuals and begin to move us
towards that idealised future. In such a society, the positive impacts
of transparency would be evident. The general principle that
transparency allows trust to be earned (which can in turn benefit
organisations themselves) could be applied in a wide range of service
endeavours that are currently very closed. This would allow innovation
in data access and process involvement to flourish.</p>
<p>The vision of these new empowered individuals, given new inclusive
roles in the lives of their data, therefore, is the ultimate answer to
<a href="#RQ">the research question</a> this thesis set out to answer:
This data-empowered and process-involved future is what better HDR looks
like.</p>
