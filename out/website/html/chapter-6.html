<blockquote>
<p><em>“For a participatory system to work, you need: a plausible
promise, an effective tool, and an acceptable bargain.”</em> —Clay
Shirky (author and journalist focused on the social and economic effects
of Internet technologies)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It will be already evident to the reader that there are significant
overlaps and parallels to be drawn across the findings and discursive
insights in Case Study One (CS1) and Case Study Two (CS2). In this first
discussion chapter, I will draw on both Chapter 4 and Chapter 5 to
produce a unified summary of findings and insights in terms of the first
two research subquestions RQ1 and RQ2. To recap on the research
objectives expressed in <a href="#3.3">3.3</a>, these two RQs are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>RQ1: “What is the human experience of personal data, and
what do people want from their data?”</strong></li>
<li><strong>RQ2: “What role does data play in people’s service
relationships and how could relationships involving data be
improved?”</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The answers to these research questions are best expressed as an
understanding of individual <em><strong>wants</strong></em> relating to
data. The word ‘want’ is used here in a broader sense than its everyday
meaning, referring to the <em>lack of something that would be
beneficial</em> (which may or may not be accompanied by conscious
desire). Framing the accumulated understandings from the Case Studies in
this way, both exposes both the problem (the things that individuals do
not have or cannot do) and also provides clear goals that any imagined
solutions or improvements to the status quo would need to address. It
logically follows that any solution that better delivers on individual
<em>data wants</em> will lead to improved relations between individuals
and their data. These wants also allow us to understand what ‘better’
means, serving as a yardstick against which progress can be measured.
The concept of <em>data relations</em> will be developed further in Part
Two, but for now can be understood as two kinds of relationship people
have with their data:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>direct</em> interaction</strong> (such as through an
interface in an app or website) and</li>
<li><strong><em>indirect</em> interaction</strong> (through interacting
with services, providers or individual representatives who themselves
have access to personal data about the individual).</li>
</ul>
<p>RQ1 [<a href="#RQ1">3.3.1</a>] and RQ2 [<a href="#RQ2">3.3.2</a>] map
cleanly onto these two types of data relations. To answer RQ1 we must
identify what people want from direct data relations–which is the focus
of <a href="#6.1">6.1</a>. To answer RQ2 we must understand what people
want from indirect data relations–which is the focus of <a href="#6.2">6.2</a>. Once those two questions are answered, these new
understandings can then be contextualised [<a href="#6.3">6.3</a>] as an
answer to the overall research question and a conclusion to the academic
inquiry part of this thesis.</p>
<h2 data-number="6.1" id="6.1"><span class="header-section-number">6.1</span> Answering RQ1: What do people
want in <em>direct</em> data relations?</h2>
<p>By comparing and grouping elements of the findings from CS1 (see 4.3)
and from CS2 (see 5.4), three distinct data wants are evident when
considering <em>direct</em> data relations. All data about individuals
should be:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Visible</strong>: People want to have knowledge of data
about them and an ability to see it and effectively access it;</li>
<li><strong>Understandable</strong>: People want to be able to interpret
this data to extract meaningful information from it (and about it),
including through visualisations and summaries; and</li>
<li><strong>Useable</strong>: People want to be able to act upon this
data, including exploring it, asking questions of it, using it to serve
their own goals, and gaining personal value from it.</li>
</ol>
<p>These wants are detailed in the following subsections.</p>
<h3 data-number="6.1.1" id="6.1.1"><span class="header-section-number">6.1.1</span> Visible Data</h3>
<p><strong>Data matters to every individual now, in a way that
previously it did not.</strong> As described in <a href="#2.1.2">2.1.2</a>, the role of data in our everyday lives has
changed; data has become a material used by businesses to shape our
world. In <a href="#2.2.2">2.2.2</a> and <a href="#2.2.4">2.2.4</a> I
outlined how this change has practically manifested itself in people’s
lives. Where once data was viewed as <em>ours</em> for our personal
reference and use, the emergence of complex multi-party data ecosystems
has meant that personal data management has become a sociotechnical
&amp; societal problem, not a practical individual one. In the past,
when businesses were more local, more personal and less data-centric,
the data they held about us was minimal and much less significant to our
lives than the human relationships we had with them. Businesses grew and
data began to be considered as a resource to be processed at scale for
customer insight and marketing exploitation. Though we didn’t realise
it, our need to understand those processes to protect one’s own
interests began to grow. In the past, you didn’t need to become aware of
data storage and use, because it had little effect. Now, data has become
a substitute for direct communication with the individual being served,
as my research in both public sector [PS; <a href="#4.3.3">4.3.3</a>]
and the private sector [<a href="#5.4.3.3">5.4.3</a>] has shown. In both
domains, people do not have awareness, let alone access, to the extent
of data that exists about them. In <a href="#5.4.4.1">5.4.4</a> we saw
individuals feeling that companies forced them to hand over data in
exchange for service access, and then subsequently maintaining power
over them through holding that data, using it to make decisions, and
denying them access to that data or even be clear about what data is
held.</p>
<p><strong>Data sacrifice is now required for many services, putting
individuals at risk.</strong> Be it the personal financial, health and
lifestyle data collected on an Early Help (EH) assessment form when a
family signs up for EH support [<a href="#4.1.2">4.1.2</a>], or the
contact details, payment information and preferences provided when
individuals register with commercial service providers such as insurance
providers or streaming media platforms [<a href="#5.4.4.1">5.4.4</a>],
supplying your personal data is required to access services. Consent to
hold and use this data is enforced upon signup, through waiver forms or
Terms &amp; Conditions agreements. Service providers in both sectors see
the acquisition of more personal data as beneficial to their operations,
be it support workers wanting to gain more data about families’ lives
[<a href="#4.2.3">4.2.3</a>; <a href="#4.2.6">4.2.6</a>], or commercial
providers using trackers to gain more insight about users that they can
exploit for advertising <span class="citation" data-cites="binns2022">(<a href="#ref-binns2022" role="doc-biblioref">Binns, 2022</a>)</span>. In both domains, this
sacrifice is seen to have an emotional effect on people, ranging from
curiosity to fear and distrust [PS; <a href="#5.4.4">5.4.4</a>]. Such
fears are well-founded, with mistreatment through incorrect data known
in both settings [<a href="#4.2.2">4.2.2</a>;<a href="#5.4.4.1">5.4.4</a>]. While data holders almost certainly do not
<em>intend</em> to cause harm, data <em>can</em> be ‘used against you’
(P2’s quote in <a href="#5.4.4.1">5.4.4</a>) <span class="citation" data-cites="kroger2021 strohmayer2021">(<a href="#ref-kroger2021" role="doc-biblioref">Kröger, Miceli and Müller, 2021</a>; <a href="#ref-strohmayer2021" role="doc-biblioref">Strohmayer <em>et
al.</em>, 2021</a>)</span>. In providers’ eyes, people are now
represented through data [<a href="#2.1.2">2.1.2</a>]. Despite the fact
that data is never truly objective <span class="citation" data-cites="gitelman2013 taylor2015">(<a href="#ref-gitelman2013" role="doc-biblioref">Gitelman, 2013</a>; <a href="#ref-taylor2015" role="doc-biblioref">Taylor <em>et al.</em>, 2015</a>)</span> and a
recognition (at least on the public sector side) that a data record can
never tell the full story [<a href="#4.2.6">4.2.6</a>; PS], the data
record becomes the object to be administered, rather than the individual
<span class="citation" data-cites="cornford2013 zuboff2019">(<a href="#ref-cornford2013" role="doc-biblioref">Cornford, Baines and
Wilson, 2013</a>; <a href="#ref-zuboff2019" role="doc-biblioref">Zuboff,
2019</a>)</span>, and this in itself creates risk - through mishandling
or inaccuracy. Given the data record is seen as a source of truth [<a href="#4.1.2">4.1.2</a>; <a href="#5.5.3">5.5.3</a>], it is vital that
such information remains <em>fair</em>, and <em>accurate</em>; this is
especially important in the commercial sector, where people are only
just beginning to become aware of data misuses and data exploitations
that are actually happening <span class="citation" data-cites="avast2022databrokers chang2018 mcnamee2019 zuckerman2021">(<a href="#ref-chang2018" role="doc-biblioref">Chang, 2018</a>; <a href="#ref-mcnamee2019" role="doc-biblioref">McNamee, 2019</a>; <a href="#ref-zuckerman2021" role="doc-biblioref">Zuckerman, 2021</a>; <a href="#ref-avast2022databrokers" role="doc-biblioref"><span>‘<span class="nocase">Data Brokers: Everything You Need to Know</span>’</span>,
2022</a>)</span>. Ensuring fairness and accuracy of held data cannot be
verified without individuals’ awareness of data held about them.</p>
<p><strong>Once data has been sacrificed, it enters a closed and opaque
ecosystem, where the individual loses access and becomes
unaware</strong> of that data’s storage and use (Luger and Rodden’s
‘point of severance’ <span class="citation" data-cites="luger2013">(<a href="#ref-luger2013" role="doc-biblioref">Luger and Rodden,
2013</a>)</span>). What was previously available for individuals to see
becomes inaccessible and invisible. In the EH context, this manifested
as families having a lack of awareness or direct access to data held
about them and having to rely on support workers as gatekeepers to
choose to inform or show them aspects of their data [<a href="#4.1.1">4.1.1</a>; <a href="#4.5">4.5</a>]. In the commercial
context, the situation is perhaps even worse, as not only is there
rarely any kind of data viewing interface, there is not even a
gatekeeper who might make people aware of their data and its use (given
DPOs rarely engage individually). Even if someone becomes motivated to
gain awareness, the GDPR leaves them in the dark; in 62% of cases, the
data that companies own privacy policies stated they collect, was not
returned, and data that was returned was complete in only 22% of cases
[<a href="#5.3.2">5.3.2</a>]. In both contexts, no awareness is gained
unless the information is actively sought. This means that the vast
majority of people, busy and unaware, remain so. This is problematic,
because people cannot judge data accuracy or protect themselves from
risk, because they may not even be aware of certain data’s existence and
use, or be able to access it even when they are.</p>
<p><strong>People want to see data which is hidden from them</strong>.
In the SILVER project [<a href="#3.4.1.1OLD">3.4.1OLD</a>; <a href="#4.2.2">4.2.2</a>], PS, and in CS1 [<a href="#4.2.6">4.2.6</a>; <a href="#4.3.2">4.3.2</a>; <a href="#4.4.2">4.4.2</a>], families wanted to
see what data was held about them (<em>‘what they’ve got on me’</em>).
They wanted to be actively kept informed and to have the ability to see
if data was fair and accurate. In the commercial context, the same
feelings were found; participants expressed a great desire to see and
know what companies are storing about them, especially data collected or
inferred about them without their involvement. This is not just a
desire, but a need, given that data can have impact on their daily lives
as it is used to inform decisions on how content is presented and
recommended to them, and what services they are advertised, offered or
can access [<a href="#5.5.3">5.5.3</a>]. We also see from CS2 that
awareness is not a binary. It includes having an appreciation of why the
existence and use of certain data is significant and what its
implications might be. Article 13.2.f of the GDPR <span class="citation" data-cites="gdpr2018art13">(<a href="#ref-gdpr2018art13" role="doc-biblioref"><span>‘<span class="nocase">Article 13: Information
to be provided where personal data are collected from the data
subject</span>’</span>, 2020</a>)</span> states that, at least in the
case of automated decision making, people are entitled to meaningful
information about the significance of the processing of their data, yet
such explanations were typically not given to participants in CS2.</p>
<p><strong>Effective access to held data is required for
visibility</strong>. Having gained awareness of data held and of the
significance of it, people want that to be accompanied by meaningful
access to the data itself. In CS1 [<a href="#4.3.2.1">4.3.2</a>; <a href="#4.4.2">4.4.2</a>], we saw families and support workers recognise
the need to accommodate the differences in families’ digital literacy,
mental and physical handicaps, and technology skills while providing
them access to the data held about them. This mirrors Gurstein’s call
for <em>‘effective access for everyone’</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="gurstein2011">(<a href="#ref-gurstein2011" role="doc-biblioref">Gurstein, 2011</a>)</span>. Four aspects in
particular are relevant here: the content and formatting of the data
(which should support different levels of linguistic and computer
literacy), the capabilities made available in terms of software,
hardware and Internet access (sufficiently powerful, sufficiently
available and affordable), and skills (ensuring that individuals are
able to interpret the data). In CS2, we saw several participants feeling
that data was delivered in too-technical formats [<a href="#5.4.3.2">5.4.3</a>], or that they lacked the skill to properly
interpret the data [<a href="#5.4.3.1">5.4.3</a>]. Effective access and
interpreting data goes beyond visibility of data and includes
understandability, which is explored in the next section.</p>
<p><strong>Visibility of, and access to, data must be timely, and
ongoing</strong>. Given the ever-changing nature of data (and indeed of
the lives of the people it represents), occasional or one-off access is
not sufficient. In HDI theory, this concept is described as having
<em>negotiability</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="mortier2013 mortier2014">(<a href="#ref-mortier2013" role="doc-biblioref">Mortier <em>et al.</em>, 2013</a>, <a href="#ref-mortier2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span>: the
ability to re-evaluate data and associated decisions as contexts change
externally. It is also mentioned by Gurstein, who points out that
time-limited access to data would not be effective <span class="citation" data-cites="gurstein2011">(<a href="#ref-gurstein2011" role="doc-biblioref">Gurstein, 2011</a>)</span>. In the EH context,
families wanted access to their data outside of support meetings; this
implies the availability of self-service interfaces that you can use
<em>in your own time</em>, rather than being reliant on the support
worker as gatekeeper. People wanted to see all data about them directly,
through a personal interface, as reflected in their workshop designs [<a href="#4.3.2.3">4.3.2</a>]. This echoed PS findings that continuing
rights and visibility of data over time are needed in order enable
vigilance over keeping data accurate and meaningful as life changes.
Timeliness also implies that access to an up-to-date view of the data
does not require special and ongoing effort by the individual, it is
always available. Both support workers and supported families saw value
in notification feeds about changes to data records [<a href="#4.3.3.3">4.3.3</a>], so that changes are discovered and can be
acted upon without having to wait for the next support meeting. In the
commercial context, we can see that GDPR provides a form of access that
is not at all timely. The 30-day delay on request processing guarantees
that data will be out of date by the time it is viewed, and individuals
must repeatedly make GDPR requests to maintain an up-to-date view (and
in doing so, they risk the imposition of charges as GDPR states that
requests should not be excessive and that fees can be levied for
additional copies). This lack of timeliness in the design of GDPR data
access motivates my third suggestion to policymakers in <a href="#5.5.1">5.5.1</a>, that they should offer ongoing access rather
than the one-off delivery of data packages.</p>
<p><strong>For held data to become visible, systemic support is needed,
including governance, advocacy and assistance</strong>. Offering access
to data is not solvable at a purely technical level. Even a well-built
data interface with 24/7 access would not provide the depth and breadth
of visibility people want. As observed in CS2, even those companies that
provide instant data access portals such as Google and Facebook did not
provide participants with all the data they desired, nor all the answers
they sought [<a href="#5.4.2.3">5.4.2</a>], and most companies offered
negligible follow-up support after data had been delivered [<a href="#5.3.3">5.3.3</a>]. Further investigations into data access
conducted as part of the <em>digipower</em> investigation [<a href="#ari-digipower-OLD">ARI-7.2</a>] confirmed CS2’s findings that SAR
requests and data portals rarely provide insight into some of the most
desired types of data including derived and acquired data and data
transfers. Effective access and visibility also requires advocacy <span class="citation" data-cites="gurstein2011">(<a href="#ref-gurstein2011" role="doc-biblioref">Gurstein, 2011</a>)</span>: people require support
and training to make use of their data. Furthermore, given the
insufficient breadth of returned data from companies [<a href="#5.3.3">5.3.3</a>; <a href="#5.4.2.2">5.4.2</a>] and near-total
lack of access to data on the public sector side [<a href="#4.3.2.2">4.3.2</a>;<a href="#4.3.2.3">4.3.2</a>], it is clear
that external governance <span class="citation" data-cites="gurstein2011">(<a href="#ref-gurstein2011" role="doc-biblioref">Gurstein, 2011</a>)</span> to ensure effective
access is needed. Without the sort of pressure on data-holders that only
policymakers can exert, organisations will not be compelled to provide
richer responses or better information-access support [<a href="#5.4.2.2">5.4.2</a>; <a href="#5.5.1">5.5.1</a>], and while small
improvements can be achieved through individual action, people generally
lack the means to effectively <em>demand</em> the increased visibility
required [<a href="#5.5.3">5.5.3</a>]. The impact of this lack of
governance is most keenly felt in the PDE/MyData space [<a href="#2.3.4">2.3.4</a>], where emergent actors seek to encourage
data-holding organisations to enable greater information access so that
they might build better data access tools for individuals, but are
hampered by a lack of top-down governance supporting their requests as
well as a lack of funding and investment by data-holders in data
advocacy.</p>
<p><strong>If data is not visible, this can lead to subjection,
alienation and exclusion</strong>. Throughout both Case Studies, we have
seen the negative psychological effects of people not being able to see
their data. Families in both my earlier work with families [the pilot
study <span class="citation" data-cites="bowyer2018family">(<a href="#ref-bowyer2018family" role="doc-biblioref">Bowyer <em>et
al.</em>, 2018</a>)</span>, hereafter ‘PS’] and CS1 were caused
significant worries by not being able to see their data. People do not
want to be treated like <em>subjects</em> (in either sense of one being
subjugated [PS], or as a topic being discussed) and reducing people to a
set of assertions in data causes them to become, in effect ‘objects to
be administered’, which is harmful and disempowering [<a href="#4.2.3">4.2.3</a>; <a href="#4.3.4.2">4.3.4</a>; <span class="citation" data-cites="cornford2013">Cornford, Baines and Wilson
(<a href="#ref-cornford2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span>].
Supported families felt helpless and resigned to being judged through
data and sometimes suspicious of those holding or using that data [<a href="#4.3.4.1">4.3.4</a>]. This led in some cases to withholding of
information or distrust of support workers, harming the effectiveness of
a relationship that is designed to empower [<a href="#4.4.1">4.4.1</a>].
In that same section (and in <span class="citation" data-cites="bowyer2018family">(<a href="#ref-bowyer2018family" role="doc-biblioref">Bowyer <em>et al.</em>, 2018, p. 7</a>)</span>) I
outlined how ongoing individual access to data has the potential to
transform attitudes, remove dependence and a feeling of being a subject,
and could empower families to help themselves. Such fears and worries
about unseen data were echoed in CS2, with participants exhibiting great
unawareness of held data [<a href="#table-5.4">Table 5.4</a>, <a href="#5.3.3">5.3.3</a>], and concerns over data being held out of their
sight for long periods of time [<a href="#5.4.3.3">5.4.3</a>] as well as
similar feelings of resignation or lack of choice [<a href="#5.4.4.1">5.4.4</a>; <a href="#5.6">5.6</a>]. Denying access to
held data was seen as a key source of holding power over individuals [<a href="#5.4.4.1">5.4.4</a>], and visibility of data is a key part of
assessing <em>‘to what extent the bargain’</em> (of data sacrifice for
value as described above) <em>‘is fair’</em> [<a href="#2.1.4">2.1.4</a>; <a href="#5.5.3">5.5.3</a>; <span class="citation" data-cites="larsson2018">Larsson (<a href="#ref-larsson2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>]. It is an
inherent consequence of representing people through data and then using
that data to make decisions [<a href="#2.1.2">2.1.2</a>; <span class="citation" data-cites="cornford2013">Cornford, Baines and Wilson
(<a href="#ref-cornford2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span>; PS]
that individuals become sidelined and excluded [<a href="#2.3.3">2.3.3</a>; <span class="citation" data-cites="crabtree2016">Crabtree and Mortier (<a href="#ref-crabtree2016" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span>]. Without
visibility of data, consent is not meaningful, and individual needs are
more easily ignored or overlooked.</p>
<h3 data-number="6.1.2" id="6.1.2"><span class="header-section-number">6.1.2</span> Understandable Data</h3>
<p><strong>Visibility and access to see data is not enough, people need
to be able to interpret it</strong>. Data is only valuable in so much as
it enables us to access the information which it encodes [<a href="#2.1.1">2.1.1</a>]. People need to be able to make sense of it.
When humans look at data, we inevitably attempt to interpret it to see
what it can tell them; in EH, support workers try to learn more about
people’s lives by examining data about them [<a href="#4.2.3.4">4.2.3</a>; <a href="#4.3.3.1">4.3.3</a>]. In doing so
they apply their own knowledge and expectations in an attempt to extract
facts. Similarly in the context of everyday digital life data,
individuals search for value and meaning in that data, they reflect upon
it and try to relate it to their own lives [<a href="#5.4.3.1">5.4.3</a>]. While EH staff receive training on how to
understand families’ data, individuals struggle to understand their data
without sufficient support, as discussed above. Returned data from GDPR
requests is often dry and technical. It may contain codes, internal
notations or abbreviations that a layperson cannot understand [<a href="#5.4.3.1">5.4.3</a>]. Raw data is rarely sufficient to provide
clear, unambiguous and unbiased information to the reader <span class="citation" data-cites="gitelman2013 neff2013">(<a href="#ref-gitelman2013" role="doc-biblioref">Gitelman, 2013</a>; <a href="#ref-neff2013" role="doc-biblioref">Neff, 2013</a>)</span>. In
line with one of the three core principles of HDI, <em>legibility</em>,
data should be understandable by those it concerns <span class="citation" data-cites="mortier2014">(<a href="#ref-mortier2014" role="doc-biblioref">Mortier <em>et al.</em>, 2014</a>)</span>. In both
Case Studies (and my prior work), individuals shared a desire to not
just be aware of, but to <em>understand</em> what data was held about
them and how it was used [PS; <a href="#4.3.2.4">4.3.2</a>; <a href="#5.4.2.1">5.4.2</a>]. People are only just beginning to understand
the significance of a data-centric world that uses data to make
decisions that affect their lives [<a href="#2.1.2">2.1.2</a>; <a href="#2.1.4">2.1.4</a>; <a href="#5.5.3">5.5.3</a>].</p>
<p><strong>People need understandable summaries of information content
and context.</strong> It was very clear from the findings of both Case
Studies that all humans looking at data need <em>summaries</em> to help
them digest and locate key information. In CS2 participants were often
overwhelmed or <em>‘drowning’</em> (P1) at the volume or technical
complexity of the data returned from access requests, <em>‘so much of it
that’s impossible to know what it all means’</em> (P4) [<a href="#5.4.3.1">5.4.3</a>]. These feelings were mirrored in CS1, by
support workers who feared the liability of having to <em>‘trawl
through’</em> large volumes of data and know all the relevant and
important facts about a family so that they do not make mistakes [<a href="#4.3.2.1">4.3.2</a>]. Participants on both sides talked of needing
help to see the whole picture, something that is hard to achieve from
individual datapoints or sets of files. In both cases, summaries of data
would help comprehension. However, the task of creating a summary is not
straightforward and places power in the hands of the summary-maker, who
can decide what is relevant, how the data is framed and what is omitted
from the summary. People look at information for different reasons, to
answer different questions, so the question of who decides what is
relevant or most important within a body of data is a critical one.
Different summaries would be needed for different audiences. As Mortier
reminds us, effective legibility requires a recognition that
individuals’ viewpoints of data can and should differ <span class="citation" data-cites="mortier2014">(<a href="#ref-mortier2014" role="doc-biblioref">Mortier <em>et al.</em>, 2014</a>)</span>. There is
a question about who decides what the viewer of a summary ‘needs to
know’ [<a href="#4.3.3.1">4.3.3</a>; <a href="#4.3.4.3">4.3.4</a>]. This
is further complicated by the fact that the data itself is not neutral
<span class="citation" data-cites="gitelman2013">(<a href="#ref-gitelman2013" role="doc-biblioref">Gitelman,
2013</a>)</span>; in the EH context it was clear that opinions as well
as facts are recorded (<span class="citation" data-cites="bowyer2018family">(<a href="#ref-bowyer2018family" role="doc-biblioref">Bowyer <em>et al.</em>, 2018, p. p6</a>)</span> and
from SILVER project), and a focus on the recording of data most helpful
to the support worker. Commercial data holders record data in ways that
are optimised for their existing systems and processes, as seen through
the presence of internal codes, system screenshots and filenames in
returned data [<a href="#5.4.3.2">5.4.3</a>]. In CS2 most participants’
comments on returned data indicated that it had not been not presented
in a way optimised for understanding [<a href="#5.4.3.1">5.4.3</a>],
failing to support <em>sensemaking</em>;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Information presentation should be as clear as possible so that
people can interpret their data and extract meaningful information from
it.”</em>—<span class="citation" data-cites="gurstein2011">Gurstein (<a href="#ref-gurstein2011" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Rather than raw data, people need information and
visualisations, arranged and optimised for understanding.</strong> Data,
by itself, is not meaningful. In order to be able to answer questions
and acquire knowledge, people need information [<a href="#2.1.1">2.1.1</a>]. Access to raw data files or database records
or spreadsheets does not satisfy this, and prior research in the civic
data context states that this would be inadequate and limiting <span class="citation" data-cites="cornford2013">(<a href="#ref-cornford2013" role="doc-biblioref">Cornford, Baines and Wilson, 2013</a>)</span>. To
comprehend the meaning of data, visualisations and explanations can help
[<a href="#4.4.2">4.4.2</a>]; as one support worker in CS1 observed,
some families might find data tables too technical, <em>‘I think
sometimes it’s easier to do it in pictures’</em> [<a href="#4.3.2.1">4.3.2</a>]. Participant-designed interfaces in CS1
included pie charts, graphs, spider diagrams and timelines, all designed
to convey information more intuitively [<a href="#4.3.2.1">4.3.2</a>].
In CS2 and prior GDPR requests, it was often the case that companies
often returned data not in understandable forms that were less useful
than the apps or websites those service providers offer. For example,
run-tracking apps such as Nike+ and Strava return route log information
in XML-based TCX files which are meaningless without some analysis tool
or visualisation. JSON files, a commonly returned data format, often use
a timestamp format that is just a long number, not understandable by
humans without extra work. Data was often returned in formats that were
more a reflection of internal systems (e.g. screenshots, table dumps or
exports) than being optimised for understanding [<a href="#5.4.3.1">5.4.3</a>], which some participants found useless. As P5
observed, <em>‘It’s like being given the bricks to a house… It doesn’t
really mean anything when it’s just bricks, if you don’t know how to put
it together’</em> [<a href="#5.4.3.2">5.4.3</a>]. It is clear that
visualisations are key to accelerating understanding (and are also
subject to the same challenges of selection and bias as summaries).
Furthermore, visualisations of data can function as powerful
<em>boundary objects</em> and <em>things to think with</em> [PS; <span class="citation" data-cites="brandt2004">Brandt and Messeter (<a href="#ref-brandt2004" role="doc-biblioref">2004</a>)</span>; <a href="#3.5.2">3.5.2</a>; <a href="#4.4.2">4.4.2</a>]. In the care
context the use of data representations as a focal point or evidence for
was thought to be more productive and empowering [<a href="#4.3.2.2">4.3.2</a>; <a href="#4.4.1">4.4.1</a>].</p>
<p><strong>Information becomes most meaningful when it is recognisable
and relatable and can be mapped back to life experiences.</strong>
Across both case studies, there was a clear search for meaning in data,
which manifested as a desire to use that data to build a fuller picture
of the individual (or family)‘s life. In CS1 and in SILVER, it was
evident that support workers seek a broader view into supported
families’ lives by reviewing data about them [<a href="#4.3.2">4.3.2</a>; <a href="#4.3.3.1">4.3.3</a>]. Both supported
families and staff saw value in seeing all the data about each
individual in a common place - in other words, structuring the
information around the individual’s life, rather than the information
silos of different agencies [<a href="#4.3.2.3">4.3.2</a>]. In CS2,
where participants were asked about the value they saw in the data
companies held about them [<a href="#5.3.3">5.3.3</a>], it was clear
that data was most valuable to participants when it was recognisable and
relatable to events in their lives. This is particularly important for
data that participants have never seen before such as derived, acquired
or metadata - without a way to connect it to one’s own life, it is
impossible to relate to [<a href="#5.3.3">5.3.3</a>]. Echoing goals
surfaced in personal informatics literature <span class="citation" data-cites="li2010">(<a href="#ref-li2010" role="doc-biblioref">Li,
Forlizzi and Dey, 2010</a>)</span>, participants sought insights about
themselves in data, and so valued data that spanned a longer time period
such that they might use it to spot patterns in relation to events in
their lives [<a href="#5.4.3.1">5.4.3</a>]. They valued the opportunity
to use data as <em>‘a window into the past’</em> [P11 in <a href="#5.4.3.1">5.4.3</a>]. Long term data was seen as a liability [<a href="#5.4.3.3">5.4.3</a>], and when it came to considering attitudes to
providers, participants were most concerned about data collection by the
larger data companies like Google and Facebook who, through their myriad
apps, websites, devices and other means, had many touchpoints into their
lives and thus had a broader picture of their life activity [<a href="#5.4.3.3">5.4.3</a>; <a href="#5.4.4.2">5.4.4</a>]. It is clear
that to transform dry, technical data into meaningful information, it
should be contextualised in relation to events in the life of the
individual it describes.</p>
<p><strong>In practice, ongoing human support is needed to facilitate
the understanding of data.</strong> In both case studies, participants
felt that they had questions to ask of data holders, especially when the
data was difficult to understand but also more generally when the answer
to a given question could not be found in the data. In PS and CS1,
participants emphasised the ability to talk to someone about their data
[<a href="#4.3.2.4">4.3.2</a>], and included such features in their
designs - both to understand and receive help in understanding, but also
to feedback and provide additional information, explanation or context
so that they might be better understood [<a href="#4.3.3.4">4.3.3</a>].
In some cases, families needed additional support for reasons of
accessibility or technical literacy. Human communication channels for
data support need to be available at convenient times too; in CS1
individuals felt constrained by needing to wait until their next meeting
with a support worker, and wanted a communication channel they could use
in their own time. In CS2, participants were regularly frustrated by
data they could not fully understand and could not ask about: sometimes
literally, when internal codes were not explained or technical formats
were used, and sometimes when they could not understand how the
information had been derived, such as insurer’s driving scores [<a href="#5.4.3.1">5.4.3</a>] or Instagram’s inferred interests. The
general pattern of GDPR handling by organisations was to deliver data,
often handled by a back-end team with no customer face or means to ask
follow-up questions. Where questions were asked, they were typically
hindered by delays and middlemen preventing an effective conversation
[<a href="#5.3.3">5.3.3</a>]. Considering the systemic changes toward
data-centricity that the world has undergone, as described in <a href="#2.1.2">2.1.2</a> and <a href="#2.2.4">2.2.4</a>, it is no
surprise that human support has reduced. Across both studies we see the
cost of that shift toward dealing with data instead of dealing with
people; individuals get left behind, without the means to understand or
ask about their data.</p>
<p><strong>If data is not understandable, distrust can arise.</strong>
In both Case Studies, the costs of individuals not being able to
understand their data and being left in an unsatisfactory position of
being unable to resolve concerns or ask questions is evident: Without
understanding, comes distrust. In CS1, participants were concerned when
they saw assertions on their records that they disputed or could not
identify the source of. In CS2, privacy policies that were too vague in
their explanations of data (such as Google’s) caused participant
distrust because they seemed broad and lacked tangible examples, and
large volumes of technical data caused suspicion. It is clear that
understandable information about what is represented in data, and about
the context and use of that data, can help individuals to trust the data
holder. In the minority of cases in CS2 where the GDPR had a positive
impact, the reasons given included understandable data and helpful human
responses, for example P10 cited Niantic’s detailed data and positive
attitude, while P6 described Sunderland AFC as upfront, and said that
their data <em>‘just made sense’</em>. P7 specifically distrusted
LinkedIn because she felt they had not bothered to adequately engage
with her [<a href="#5.4.4.3">5.4.4</a>]. The importance of trust will be
discussed in more detail in [<a href="#6.2.1">6.2.1</a>] below.</p>
<h3 data-number="6.1.3" id="6.1.3"><span class="header-section-number">6.1.3</span> Useable<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>
Data</h3>
<p><strong>People need to be able to explore and interrogate data to ask
questions of it.</strong> In both case studies, many participants showed
they are aware that their personal data contains insights and value they
cannot access. In CS1 and PS this manifested as concern over what unseen
incriminating judgements might be storied in their records, and an
awareness that the only data supported families can actually see is
whatever subset of data their support worker chooses to share with them
[<a href="#4.3.4.1">4.3.4</a>]. In CS2, this manifested as feelings of
not having the technical skills necessary to explore their returned data
[<a href="#5.6">5.6</a>] and that without better tools individuals were
not getting the same view of data that service provider staff have [P2
in <a href="#5.4.3.1">5.4.3</a>]. What we can see from these
observations is that even visible, understandable data is not enough to
meet people’s needs. People need to be able to interact with their data,
in order to explore it, gain insights or answer questions. There is a
need for tools not only to access data, but to help people make sense of
(often technically formatted) data [<a href="#5.4.3.1">5.4.3</a>], and
explore it in different ways to answer questions - which implies the
need for operations such as filtering, searching, comparing and
orienteering (see <a href="#2.1.4">2.1.4</a> for others), in order to
understand history, context and patterns in the data, as suggested in
self informatics (SI) literature [<a href="#2.2.3">2.2.3</a>]. Several
participants in CS2 hoped to receive data in formats they could
visualise, <em>‘mash up’</em> and play with, but did not get this - not
only was data not optimally formatted for such use, it lacked sufficient
explanation to enable individuals to pursue such goals for themselves
[<a href="#5.4.3.2">5.4.3</a>].</p>
<p><strong>Data needs to be useable - correctly formatted and explained
in a portable and standardised form.</strong> As discussed in <a href="#5.6">5.6</a> and <a href="#5.4.3.2">5.4.3</a>, people have
multiple needs around data: For understanding, people need
<em>understandable information</em>, both the facts and assertions
encoded within the data, but also information about the data itself -
its context, history, use, and significance. But there is a distinct
need for <em>useable data</em>, which is somewhat orthogonal to this. A
PDF containing a screenshot from an internal system might potentially be
sufficient for understanding, but is useless for exploration or
visualisation-building. Similarly a technical log file might contain
rich data that can be queried and visualised given the right tools, but
without those tools or an informational summary, is of no immediate
value [<a href="#5.4.3.2">5.4.3</a>]. This dilemma was alluded to by P4
in CS2 thus: <em>‘If you want to view the data they have about you, it’s
quite useable. If you want to do something [analytical], then it’s
not’</em> [<a href="#5.4.3.2">5.4.3</a>]. This dichotomy of needs is
discussed in <a href="#5.5.1">5.5.1</a>, where the introduction of
standard formats is proposed as a means to catalyse the building of data
insight interfaces. As P1 stated, <em>‘it would be nice if these
companies had a standardised model of how this information is presented
to people’</em> [<a href="#5.4.3.1">5.4.3</a>].</p>
<p><strong>People need to be able to interact with data, which means
interfaces are needed</strong>. By themselves, even standardised files
as described above are not practically useable. As discussed in <a href="#4.4.2">4.4.2</a> and consistent with effective access <span class="citation" data-cites="gurstein2011">(<a href="#ref-gurstein2011" role="doc-biblioref">Gurstein, 2011</a>)</span> participant data designs
in CS2 remind us that simply providing data is not sufficient: to be
meaningfully able to act upon data requires some form of interface not
only for visualisation and interrogation as mentioned above, but also so
that any physical, cognitive or accessibility needs can be met. In CS2,
some participants wanted not just for data access, but for tools to help
them find insights from their data [<a href="#5.5.3">5.5.3</a>; <a href="#5.6">5.6</a>]. While several companies are starting to create
interfaces for data access, most of these are still focussed upon file
delivery, with the notable exception of Google Timeline and Google My
Activity, which provide a glimpse how an interface to explore data could
be more useful than providing a bundle of files. Both of these examples
also re-iterate the value of unifying data around an individual’s life,
as discussed in <a href="#4.3.2.3">4.3.2</a> and above in <a href="#6.1.2">6.1.2</a> above.</p>
<p><strong>Data needs to be explorable from a temporal
perspective</strong>. Another aspect of useable data that goes beyond
what a data file can offer is the ability to view it over time. The
importance of this temporal capability, as identified in literature
cited in <a href="#2.1.4">2.1.4</a> (practical information access) and
<a href="#2.2.2.4">2.2.2</a> (temporal PIM systems), and my prior
writing <span class="citation" data-cites="bowyer2011filesdie">(<a href="#ref-bowyer2011filesdie" role="doc-biblioref">Bowyer,
2011</a>)</span>, was evident in both Case Studies. In SILVER and in
CS1, being able to access historical data for a full picture regularly
surfaced as a desire in discussions - even though the exact bounds and
mechanisms for achieving this were contentious [<a href="#4.2.6">4.2.6</a>; <a href="#4.3.2.1">4.3.2</a>; <a href="#4.3.3.1">4.3.3</a>]. In CS2, as <a href="#table-5.4">Table
5.4</a> shows, 26% of participant goals related to SI-type reflection
[<a href="#2.2.3">2.2.3</a>] on one’s past to enable self-insights,
nostalgia and creative uses of data. No participant was able to achieve
this, and this was in large part due to the lack of temporal data
exploration capability, meaning that significant potential value (the
value of a long-term dataset as described above) remained locked away
and inaccessible [<a href="#5.3">5.3</a>; <a href="#5.6">5.6</a>]. CS2
also suggested a lack of thought to this temporal perspective from data
holders, who delivered data as a one-off snapshot that was already
out-of-date when delivered. Indeed the GDPR explicitly discourages
excessive data requests, rendering an ongoing view of data as proposed
in <a href="#5.5.1">5.5.1</a> near impossible. Having better temporal
data exploration capabilities would enable people to understand
themselves and their data ecosystems better, informing both personal
self-improvement goals and better decisions about personal data
practices and provider choices [<a href="#5.6">5.6</a>]. Other
exploration perspectives that could be powerful include location-based
views or person/company/relationship-based views.</p>
<p><strong>People need to be able to access the valuable knowledge
locked within their data.</strong> People need to see the complete
picture of their data in order that they might access at least glean as
much value and insight from it as data holders do [<a href="#5.4.3.1">5.4.3</a>]. For self-improvement and improving one’s
situation (a key goal of EH), access to metrics visible in data are
extremely important, so that one might measure progress [<a href="#4.3.2.4">4.3.2</a>]. While support workers do endeavour to
provide this and sometime show data extracts, this can never be as
empowering as having full capabilities to explore that data <em>‘in your
own time, at your own pace’</em> [PS; <a href="#4.3.2.4">4.3.2</a>]. In
commercial service provider relationships, data interfaces present data
in ways that are configured to reflect the profit motives of the
organisation (explored further in my work with Goffe <em>et al.</em>
<span class="citation" data-cites="goffe2021">(<a href="#ref-goffe2021" role="doc-biblioref">Goffe <em>et al.</em>, 2021</a>)</span>), and so
accessing a relevant view of one’s own data and having the means to
access the knowledge within it is similarly difficult. Participants in
CS2 found returned data unuseable [<a href="#5.4.3.2">5.4.3</a>], and
wanted visualisations that would allow them to discover patterns and
insights, and tools to explore their data [<a href="#5.4.3.1">5.4.3</a>;
<a href="#5.5.3">5.5.3</a>]. If data holders can make data not just
visible but useable, individuals can learn about the valuable knowledge
that data holders are currently extracting from their data, and
hopefully how to access that knowledge for themselves.</p>
<p><strong>If holders do not make data useable, this is a barrier to
individual agency and power.</strong> In Human-Data Interaction terms,
people need not just legibility, but <em>agency</em> - the ability to
act upon one’s data <span class="citation" data-cites="mortier2014">(<a href="#ref-mortier2014" role="doc-biblioref">Mortier <em>et al.</em>,
2014</a>)</span>. Personal data contains valuable and actionable
information about individuals and their lives [<a href="#5.5.3">5.5.3</a>]. The SI field has identified that there are
already many practical barriers to working with one’s personal data
effectively, including not just access but challenges in integration,
sensemaking and goal-tracking—the ‘barriers cascade’ <span class="citation" data-cites="li2010">(<a href="#ref-li2010" role="doc-biblioref">Li, Forlizzi and Dey, 2010</a>)</span>—which hinder
the ability to use one’s data for personal benefit. As observed in CS2,
an inability to access the value in your own data can lead to feelings
of resignation, concern, suspicion or distrust [<a href="#5.6">5.6</a>].
Even if one can see and understand one’s data, an inability to act upon
it can reinforce feelings of being passive and uninvolved; without this,
any opportunity to feel engaged and motivated is lost <span class="citation" data-cites="bowyer2018family">(<a href="#ref-bowyer2018family" role="doc-biblioref">Bowyer <em>et
al.</em>, 2018, p. p8</a>)</span>. Being able to use data for one’s own
purposes is a critical ingredient of empowerment and rebalancing power
<span class="citation" data-cites="wef2014lens">(<a href="#ref-wef2014lens" role="doc-biblioref">Hoffman, 2014a</a>)</span>.
Without data usability, individuals are in effect digitally impaired,

<h2 data-number="6.2" id="6.2"><span class="header-section-number">6.2</span> Answering RQ2: What do people
want in <em>indirect</em> data relations?</h2>
<p>By comparing and grouping elements of the findings from CS1 [<a href="#4.3">4.3</a>] and from CS2 [<a href="#5.4">5.4</a>], especially
in the context of individual relationships with care providers and
digital service providers respectively, three distinct data wants are
evident when considering <em>indirect</em> data relations:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Process Transparency</strong>: People need to know what data
is being collected or held, and critically how it is being used, for
accountability and safety and in order to have trust in data
holders;</li>
<li><strong>Individual Oversight</strong>: People need the ability to
affect what data is held and how it is used, including reacting to
changing circumstances, deleting data or withdrawing consent for certain
uses; and</li>
<li><strong>Involvement in Decision Making</strong>: People need to be
invited and involved in decision making based upon their data, so that
they are not misrepresented and their needs are not overlooked. This can
be aided by collaborative use of data, giving individuals a human point
of contact, and consulting the person not just the record.</li>
</ol>
<p>These wants are detailed in the following sections:</p>
<h3 data-number="6.2.1" id="want-i1"><span class="header-section-number">6.2.1</span> Process Transparency</h3>
<p><strong>People need a window into how their data is used; this means
transparency of processes not just of data</strong>. It is
well-established that there is currently extensive use of personal data
by service providers and other parties that is beyond an individual’s
view <span class="citation" data-cites="wef2011">(<a href="#ref-wef2011" role="doc-biblioref">Hoffman, 2011</a>)</span>, forming an ecosystem of
data use based upon one’s data, which is currently not centred on or
visible to the individual concerned [<a href="#2.3.4">2.3.4</a>].
Decisions made based upon personal data directly affect people’s lives
through policy decisions (in the care context) or business/functionality
decisions (in the commercial context). People need to understand the
value created by the use of their data and how (if at all) they are
compensated for this <span class="citation" data-cites="wef2011">(<a href="#ref-wef2011" role="doc-biblioref">Hoffman, 2011</a>)</span>. Even
with full data access, understanding and useability, individuals cannot
see into this opaque world of data use; the data is just an artefact
produced and shaped by unseen processes. Like an archaeologist trying to
infer the customs of lost civilisations through ancient relics,
observation of the data can only reveal so much. Andrew Cormack, writing
before GDPR, observed that <em>‘it is more important to know how
information is processed than the actual values involved’</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="cormack2016">(<a href="#ref-cormack2016" role="doc-biblioref">Cormack, 2016</a>)</span>. The SILVER project found
that families had very little awareness or understanding how their data
was used, and that consent was therefore not meaningful because consent
had been given without processual understanding [<a href="#4.2.2">4.2.2</a>]. In CS1 participants agreed that people need
rights to see how their data is used [<a href="#4.2.6">4.2.6</a>]. CS2
revealed a clear desire for awareness of how data is used, how decisions
are made, and how this might affect them [<a href="#5.4.2.1">5.4.2</a>],
with over 74% of goals in pursuing GDPR requests relating to wanting
greater insight into personal data use practices [<a href="#5.3.2">5.3.2</a>]. 70% of participants wanted to understand what
providers infer from their data and this was unmet in 73% of cases and
fully met in only 7% of cases [<a href="#5.3.2">5.3.2</a>].</p>
<p><strong>Process transparency is required to enable
accountability.</strong> In CS2, participants recognised that
organisations had collected data about them which could be exploited,
and wanted to understand the extent of that capability [<a href="#5.4.3.3">5.4.3</a>]. Data access can provide a window into
collection capability, but only process transparency can reveal the
extent of data use capability. Many participants expressed a desire to
assess the trustworthiness of their service providers; they had
curiosity, suspicion and unanswered questions that only transparency
could address [<a href="#5.3.2">5.3.2</a>] and sought to judge whether
data use practices were “appropriate” [<a href="#5.2.4.1">5.2.4</a>]. In
the EH context, all data processing is hidden from individual view and
no access or questioning capability except through their support worker
(functioning as a selective gatekeeper) [<a href="#4.1.1">4.1.1</a>; <a href="#4.2.1">4.2.1</a>; <a href="#4.4.1">4.4.1</a>]. Returning to CS2,
there was evidently some transparency available in the form of the
ability to make a GDPR request, but many participants found GDPR
responses inadequate for holding providers accountable [<a href="#5.2.4.3">5.2.4</a>]. Nonetheless, data access request handling is
itself a data process, and so in this sense, the GDPR process did offer
some ability to judge the trustworthiness and integrity of providers in
data handling, in part informed by the breadth and quality of data
returns [<a href="#table-ari5.1">Table ARI5.1</a>] but perhaps more by
the experience of the GDPR process. Many participants formed or revise
their perceptions of companies, with perceptions of providers having a
lack of care and making access difficult, or of providers being helpful
and open having a strong impact on participants’ attitudes toward them
[<a href="#5.4.4.3">5.4.4</a>].</p>
<p><strong>There is no accountability, processes are not transparent,
and thus power remains imbalanced.</strong> Across both case studies,
the lack of process transparency is clear. EH services have no
obligation to describe or share their data use practices with supported
families, and apparently only even attempt to do so at the point of
initial onboarding and consent collection [PS; <a href="#4.2">4.2</a>].
This equates in practice to a complete lack of accountability over data
practice [<a href="#4.4.1">4.4.1</a>; <a href="#4.5">4.5</a>]. Meanwhile
in the commercial context, some companies failed to respond at all to
GDPR, which is a barrier to accountability service providers. Many
routinely failed to adequately meet the transparency rights stated by
GDPR, without repercussion or consequence [<a href="#5.4.2.2">5.4.2</a>]. In both sectors, data holders’ freedom to
collect and use data without adequate transparency or ability to be held
to account can be seen as an exertion of power over individuals. The
power imbalance (<span class="citation" data-cites="wef2011">Hoffman (<a href="#ref-wef2011" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span>, <span class="citation" data-cites="wef2014lens">Hoffman (<a href="#ref-wef2014lens" role="doc-biblioref">2014a</a>)</span>) and the
dominance of data holders over the individuals about whom data is held,
is reinforced by a lack of transparency.</p>
<p><strong>People face an incomplete picture of their data ecosystem,
even after using all available means to achieve transparency.</strong>
In SILVER and PS, supported families expressed concern that data could
not adequately represent the complexity of their lives, a view supported
by literature (<span class="citation" data-cites="cornford2013">Cornford, Baines and Wilson (<a href="#ref-cornford2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span>; <span class="citation" data-cites="gitelman2013">Gitelman (<a href="#ref-gitelman2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span>) and
sustained by support workers &amp; staff in CS1 [<a href="#4.2.6">4.2.6</a>; <a href="#4.3.3.1">4.3.3</a>]. Therefore,
transparency is vital in order to ensure data is fair and accurate to
them, yet it is not available [<a href="#4.3.4.1">4.3.4</a>] so they
have no means to ensure this. Similarly in CS2, the most popular GDPR
goals around understanding inferences made from data about people [<a href="#5.3.3">5.3.3</a>] remained unmet. Data was incomplete, delayed,
or inaccessible [<a href="#5.3.2">5.3.2</a>] and the potentially most
informative type of data when it comes to understanding
processing—metadata, derived and acquired data—were typically absent.
Apparently broad responses were discovered to be very limited when
viewed through the lens of privacy policy commitments and GDPR
transparency rights [<a href="#5.3.4">5.3.4</a>].</p>
<p><strong>Trust in data holders is needed, and gaps in transparency
create distrust and a risk of broken expectations, harming
relations.</strong> Individuals need a functional understanding of their
data and its handling, and this is crucial to trust. Good explanations
(as were often found lacking in CS2 [<a href="#5.4.3.2">5.4.3</a>] can
deliver some of this needed understanding and subsequently increase
trust <span class="citation" data-cites="glavic2021">(<a href="#ref-glavic2021" role="doc-biblioref">Glavic <em>et al.</em>,
2021</a>)</span>, as observed in a minority of cases (14%) where a good
GDPR response led to the participant’s trust in their provider
increasing. Conversely we found that incomplete data (or a general lack
of transparency/difficulties of access [<a href="#5.4.4">5.4.4</a>; <a href="#5.6">5.6</a>]) can harm trust, as in the majority of cases (52%)
can harm trust [<a href="#5.3.4">5.3.4</a>], leading to thoughts such as
‘what are they hiding?’ [<a href="#5.4.4.3">5.4.4</a>]. Privacy policies
that contradicted expectations or lacked sufficient explanations also
led to distrust [<a href="#5.3.4">5.3.4</a>]. Trust in the independence
and integrity of data holders is essential <span class="citation" data-cites="vandijck2014">(<a href="#ref-vandijck2014" role="doc-biblioref">Dijck, 2014</a>)</span>, and this was often a
concern in the EH context, where trust between support worker and
supported family is especially critical in order for the support
relationship to be effective. Earlier work found that families wanted to
be confident that their data would be handled sensitively and fairly
only by those with a need to know, and believed that greater visibility
of data processing would allow them to trust that that was the case [<a href="#4.2.2">4.2.2</a>; PS]. When families felt alienated from their
data, trust was absent [<a href="#4.4.1">4.4.1</a>], and a lack of
transparency and accountability makes it hard for families to maintain
trust in the system [<a href="#4.5">4.5</a>]. These issues of
transparency and trust are inherent in a data-centric operating
model:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“A crisis of trust is developing, stemming from the use of
personal data in ways that are inconsistent with individuals’
preferences or expectations.”</em>—World Economic Forum <span class="citation" data-cites="wef2014context">(<a href="#ref-wef2014context" role="doc-biblioref">Hoffman,
2014b</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Information facilitates trust; transparency therefore offers
an opportunity to earn trust &amp; improve relations.</strong> In both
studies, the findings indicated that increased transparency from data
holders / service providers would improve trust; in CS1 support workers
and organisations were recommended to be as open as possible about data
handling and sharing [<a href="#4.3.4.3">4.3.4</a>]. CS2 highlighted the
potential benefits of increased consumer loyalty that greater
transparency might bring [<a href="#5.5.2">5.5.2</a>], as well as the
need for policymakers to legislate in favour of increasing individuals’
understanding of data practices [<a href="#5.5.1">5.5.1</a>]. This is a
level of transparency that goes beyond current GDPR practice, and even
beyond current GDPR policy. In order to redistribute power, GDPR needs
to deliver meaningful transparency, not just the <em>‘box ticking’</em>
delivery of unhelpful files that our participants sometimes observed [<a href="#5.5.1">5.5.1</a>]. Crabtree describes meaningful transparency by
saying that it cannot be a <em>‘one-way street’</em> that reduces
individuals to <em>‘being spectators’</em> on how their data is used; he
says that it involves <em>‘making the whole ecosystem transparent, not
just the front end’</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="crabtree2016">(<a href="#ref-crabtree2016" role="doc-biblioref">Crabtree and Mortier, 2016</a>)</span>. Access to
good information about practices is the most effective way to earn trust
[<a href="#5.4.4.2">5.4.4</a>], and both studies’ findings suggest that
a proactive attitude can do just that [<a href="#4.4.1">4.4.1</a>; <a href="#4.3.4.2">4.3.4</a>; <a href="#5.5.2">5.5.2</a>; <a href="#5.6">5.6</a>].</p>
<p><strong>Initially, transparency may cause distrust, but only where
practice is problematic; this is accountability becoming real and
catalysing better data practices.</strong> It is important to note that
in CS2 we saw the transparency of GDPR cause elevated distrust [<a href="#5.3.4">5.3.4</a>], however this does not mean it should be
avoided. The reasons cited for distrust arising were invariably due to
the discovery of practices that participants did not approve of. This is
a clear illustration of the link between transparency and
accountability; the transparency reveals the non-consensual or
unsatisfactory practices that providers must change if they wish to
maintain trust and loyalty, such as unclear data practices, data
over-use or data sharing that the individual would not have consented to
had they been asked. This shows that in some cases trust is fragile,
where unfavourable practices are hidden and only the individual’s
unawareness is keeping the relationship intact [<a href="#5.4.4">5.4.4</a>]. Data holders should not only be transparent,
but should follow this up by acting upon subsequent feedback, improving
practices that individuals discover and challenge [<a href="#5.4.4.3">5.4.4</a>]. By shining a light, accountability becomes
real and change for the better can occur. Ultimately, increasing
transparency can help providers uncover exactly what they need to do to
earn greater trust [<a href="#5.6">5.6</a>].</p>
<p><strong>Without transparency of data and processes, individual action
is blocked and power remains imbalanced.</strong> Across the two
studies, a clear pattern emerges: transparency can increase trust,
enable accountability, empower individuals, and (provided organisations
respond favourably) actually tilt the power balance back toward an
equitable and fair relationship where data is collected and used in
clear sight of the individuals it concerns, where they might hold those
organisations to account and immediately challenge any unsatisfactory
practice, unauthorised processing/sharing or inaccurate data. Thanks to
GDPR, individuals are now able to take direct action to educate
themselves and pursue greater transparency, and utilise their rights to
motivate incremental changes from data holders [<a href="#5.5.3">5.5.3</a>]. Without transparency, data holders will
continue to hold the balance of power, and individuals will lack agency
and accountability.</p>
<h3 data-number="6.2.2" id="want-i2"><span class="header-section-number">6.2.2</span> Individual Oversight</h3>
<p><strong>Data visibility and process transparency naturally leads to a
desire for individual oversight.</strong> If you see something that is
‘not right’, you are motivated to want to fix it. And therefore, people
want something more than data and process transparency, the natural next
step is the ability to make decisions about what happens to their data.
Participants’ goals in CS2 included curiosity, suspicion and a desire to
shed light on specific incidents [<a href="#5.3.3">5.3.3</a>], mirroring
the desires families in PS exhibited to be able to know and see what
data was held and used about them. In both cases, individuals wanted to
have a say over what happens. Current models of informed consent have
been found to be inadequate, with the initial handover of data acting as
a <em>point of severance</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="luger2013">(<a href="#ref-luger2013" role="doc-biblioref">Luger and Rodden, 2013</a>)</span>. This was echoed
in the experiences of families in the EH context, who gave consent at
the point of initial onboarding, but lost all ability to influence what
happens to their data thereafter [PS; <a href="#4.2.2">4.2.2</a>]. GDPR
aims to adhere more to a <em>dynamic consent</em> model <span class="citation" data-cites="kaye2015 williams2015">(<a href="#ref-kaye2015" role="doc-biblioref">Kaye <em>et al.</em>,
2015</a>; <a href="#ref-williams2015" role="doc-biblioref">Williams
<em>et al.</em>, 2015</a>)</span> by giving people an ongoing set of
rights, including the right to be informed about the use of your data,
the right to object to certain data uses, and the right to get your data
corrected or deleted <span class="citation" data-cites="ico2018">(<a href="#ref-ico2018" role="doc-biblioref">Information Commissioner’s
Office, 2018</a>)</span>. In line with the <em>accountability
principle</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="ec2010accountability crabtree2016">(<a href="#ref-ec2010accountability" role="doc-biblioref">Article 29 Data
Protection Working Party, 2010</a>; <a href="#ref-crabtree2016" role="doc-biblioref">Crabtree and Mortier, 2016</a>)</span>, this in
effect would allow people to act as overseers or regulators over their
own data: watching how it is used, and demanding action or change to
practice when they see data use that goes against their wishes.</p>
<p><strong>People need agency and negotiability over held data about
them, in order to ensure fairness and accuracy and reduce risk.</strong>
As PS showed, there is a strong desire to ensure data is <em>fair</em>
and <em>accurate</em>, because that data is used to inform judgements
and make decisions that can directly affect the individuals concerned.
Data in CS2 showed a clear problem with the accuracy of unseen data:
while in 92% of cases volunteered data (which by definition, has been
seen by the individual) was found accurate, derived and acquired data
(previously unseen by the individual) was found inaccurate in 50% and
80% of cases respectively [<a href="#5.3.2">5.3.2</a>]. Being able to
ensure fair and accurate data goes beyond being able to see and
understand the data, but requires also <em>agency</em> (the ability to
act within a data system, such as to delete or correct data, or withdraw
consent) and <em>negotiability</em> (the ability to continue to have a
voice and make changes as circumstances change) <span class="citation" data-cites="mortier2014">(<a href="#ref-mortier2014" role="doc-biblioref">Mortier <em>et al.</em>, 2014</a>)</span>. People
need a relationship with their data [<a href="#2.1.5">2.1.5</a>]. In
both CSs and in PS, individuals perceived tangible risks both of data
being held beyond their reach, but also of potentially inaccurate data
being used to make decisions. Risk factors identified in the EH context
included facilitating or encouraging crime, causing social and
psychological harm, and enabling medical mismanagement or welfare
support failures. In CS2, participants felt that held data about them
that is not visible or controllable was a liability that might lead to
privacy violations, commercial exploitation, and an increased risk of
data leaks [<a href="#5.4.3.3">5.4.3</a>]. Clearly people feel that for
their data to be safe, they must be able to see and verify its storage
and use for themselves and enforce action when something is not right.
As early as 1980, when the world was less data-centric, it was already
recognised that individuals would need the ability to challenge data
use, as the OECD observed in their guidelines:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“The right of individuals to access and challenge personal data
is generally regarded as perhaps the most important privacy protection
safeguard.”</em>—<span class="citation" data-cites="OECD1980">Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (<a href="#ref-OECD1980" role="doc-biblioref">1980</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Individual oversight capabilities must be supported by
governance, so that individuals can effect desired changes.</strong> As
Gurstein notes, a key element of effective data access is governance,
that is, mandating data holders to support individuals in accessing
their data and respecting their wishes over what should happen to that
data <span class="citation" data-cites="gurstein2011">(<a href="#ref-gurstein2011" role="doc-biblioref">Gurstein,
2011</a>)</span>. Individuals need to be able to give instructions, make
changes and express permissions that have weight; they need to be
listened to, so that they can meaningfully effect change [<a href="#4.4.2">4.4.2</a>]. Bakardjieva, examining the use of data about
others in a different context (research), identified that individuals
whose data is used need the ability to influence not only the data about
them, but the actual decision making that occurs based on that data:
both the data <em>and</em> the decision making should become objects
that the individual subject can manipulate <span class="citation" data-cites="bakardjieva2001">(<a href="#ref-bakardjieva2001" role="doc-biblioref">Bakardjieva and Feenberg, 2001</a>)</span>. At the
time of writing (August 2022), much of the focus on GDPR has been about
access to data, perhaps because this is more tangible, and very little
about GDPR’s other rights that can influence decision making [<a href="#5.1.2">5.1.2</a>]. This was backed up by participant experiences
in CS2, where desires to influence or change practices or delete data
were either not actionable or ineffective [<a href="#5.4.3.3">5.4.3</a>]. Governance over individual data rights has
two elements. First, to support individuals in complaints or challenges,
which are currently unevenly enforced [<a href="#5.5.1">5.5.1</a>]. But
more importantly than this, given the extensive use of data by
organisations and the great potential for misuse or harm, individuals
need to be able to trust that systems are in place that mandate the
behaviour of data holders to be trustworthy; to compel organisations to
maintain good data practices such as data security and dynamic consent
in the first place [<a href="#5.4.4.1">5.4.4</a>]. In the GDPR context
bodies that can do this already exist–the Data Protection Authorities.
In the public sector/care context, the picture is less clear.
Participants identified a need for oversight bodies to compel good
practice, identify appropriate access rules, and to provide independent
oversight in contentious cases [<a href="#4.3.4.3">4.3.4</a>]; this is
particularly difficult given that no organisation can see the full
picture of an individual’s civic data.</p>
<p><strong>Individual oversight would bring individuals back to the
centre of their personal data ecosystem as an active
participant.</strong> As outlined in <a href="#2.3.4">2.3.4</a>, the
ideal has been established that individuals need to be at the centre of
their own personal data ecosystem, overseeing and controlling their data
selves as easily as their physical selves. This aligns with the concept
of <em>individual self-determination</em>, which is gaining ground in
PDE circles <span class="citation" data-cites="fisch2015">(<a href="#ref-fisch2015" role="doc-biblioref">Fisch, 2015</a>)</span>.
Currently, as seen in both contexts, data functions as a proxy for their
direct involvement [PS; <a href="#5.4.4.1">5.4.4</a>]. Decision makers
consult data first, as the primary source of truth [<a href="#4.1.2">4.1.2</a>; <a href="#2.1.2">2.1.2</a>], and the individual
second (if at all). For transparency to be meaningful, data flows need
to open up to include individuals as part of the loop, changing them
from passive spectators to <em>active participants</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="wef2014lens crabtree2016">(<a href="#ref-wef2014lens" role="doc-biblioref">Hoffman, 2014a</a>; <a href="#ref-crabtree2016" role="doc-biblioref">Crabtree and Mortier,
2016</a>)</span> in the processing of their data. Examples of specific
oversight abilities desired in CS1 were the ability to explain or
annotate datapoints [<a href="#4.3.3.4">4.3.3</a>], to be able to check
data together with support workers, with the record of that check
becoming part of the data [<a href="#4.3.3.2">4.3.3</a>], or to have
granular access controls over precisely which data could be seen by whom
[<a href="#4.3.3.5">4.3.3</a>]. In CS2, a clear picture emerged that
what participants want is the ability to make <em>choices</em>. They
want control over the data they are forced to sacrifice to companies [<a href="#5.4.4.1">5.4.4</a>]. To avoid the <em>point of severance</em>,
data sacrifice should be a loan or sublicense, not a
taking-possession-of.</p>
<p><strong>Given the changing and complex nature of human life, data is
inadequate and consent is never complete, so longitudinal participation
and oversight is needed.</strong> Too often, data is treated as a static
source of truth (see above). Attempting to represent people as data in
order to require less human contact is a reasonable goal from an
organisational efficiency or cost-saving perspective, but any
representation will never be complete or adequate [<span class="citation" data-cites="cornford2013">Cornford, Baines and Wilson
(<a href="#ref-cornford2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span>; PS].
In CS1, the findings showed the need for numerous efforts to augment
data in order to combat its inherent inadequacy, such as support workers
seeking to understand the people behind the records [<a href="#4.3.3.1">4.3.3</a>] and maintaining a constant attitude of
seeking to understand more deeply than the data record can allow [<a href="#4.3.4.2">4.3.4</a>]. Even if a data record can be corrected or
completed, it will still be inadequate, because human lives change
continuously: people move, start and end relationships and jobs, marry,
divorce, have children, pursue new interests, become incapacitated, or
die. The passage of time can radically change the context or relevance
of data [PS]. A one-time informed consent upon data collection is
inadequate in this ever-changing context [<a href="#4.2.2">4.2.2</a>; <a href="#4.2.6">4.2.6</a>; <a href="#4.3.3.3">4.3.3</a>]. If consent needs
to be ongoing (and in order for it to be meaningful) this means that
engagement with the individual concerned, and that individual having a
view of their data and its use, need to be ongoing too. In order to
avoid storing or using data beyond its need, ongoing data access is
needed, in order to enable ongoing individual oversight [<a href="#4.2.2">4.2.2</a>; <a href="#4.3.2.4">4.3.2</a>]. Systems and
processes must treat data as dynamic [<a href="#4.3.3.3">4.3.3</a>], as
something that will become inaccurate without sustained engagement. CS2
noted that GDPR data access is currently based upon viewing a one-time
snapshot of your data, and does not take this need for negotiability
<span class="citation" data-cites="mortier2014">(<a href="#ref-mortier2014" role="doc-biblioref">Mortier <em>et al.</em>,
2014</a>)</span> into account at all [<a href="#5.5.1">5.5.1</a>]
(though some companies now offer download dashboards that come closer to
providing ongoing access). Ongoing access, consent and participation do
carry cost implications for providers, and effort implications for
individuals - but these can be improved over time: the former through
automation, standards and education, and the latter through holistic
approaches to personal data ecosystems; these mitigations will be
explored further in Part Two.</p>
<p><strong>There is scant individual oversight available today.
Governance is lacking. If people cannot make choices about their data,
they will remain powerless.</strong> Participants in both contexts faced
an inability to see the full picture of how their data is processed and
used. Families in CS1 workshops spent time designing interfaces for
seeing and correcting their data and changing permissions [<a href="#3.5.3">3.5.3</a>; <a href="#4.3.2.1">4.3.2</a>; <a href="#4.3.2.3">4.3.2</a>], but no such interfaces exist. The entirety
of their data access and influence is limited to what can be achieved
verbally with their support workers [<a href="#4.2.4">4.2.4</a>; <a href="#4.4.3">4.4.3</a>]. Without transparency and dynamic consent
mechanisms, those families lack accountability. They are excluded with
no ability to oversee or participate in the life of their data. In CS2,
of the 41% of participant goals that concerned gaining insight into and
control over the use of their data, 66% were unmet. Participants saw no
clear pathway to use their rights to control over data. Only 1 of the 10
cases where a participant wanted to delete their data was successful [<a href="#5.3.3">5.3.3</a>]. At the time of writing, only one company
(Apple) has a privacy hub that offers clear routes to access data rights
other than access. Participants also reported in some cases being unable
to check the accuracy of their data, or to investigate specific
incidents where they had concerns [<a href="#5.3.3">5.3.3</a>]. The
general view was one of widespread disappointment, that despite the
promise of GDPR it did not confer any power to the individual to
influence data use [<a href="#5.2.4.3">5.2.4</a>], leading in some cases
to a reluctance to submit GDPR requests in future. Access requests were
also rarely seen as useful in the care context. They typically only
occur in the case of complaints. In the GDPR context, the inability to
restrict data use or delete data was seen as a lack of control, and the
retaining of data against their wishes as a liability [<a href="#5.4.3.3">5.4.3</a>]. Ultimately oversight means having choices,
which is essential in the data-centric world. The Case Studies’ findings
show that, in general, participants felt they had been forced to
sacrifice data to access services, and offered <em>no</em> practical
choices or control over that data. Without individual oversight, there
is no choice and people remain powerless.</p>
<h3 data-number="6.2.3" id="want-i3"><span class="header-section-number">6.2.3</span> Involvement in Decision
Making</h3>
<p><strong>Data represents people. But people are more than can be
encapsulated in records. There is a need to engage the human behind the
data, as people can never be fully represented in data.</strong>
Intrinsic in the move towards data-centricity has been a move away from
human involvement. In the commercial sector this is due to cost-saving
(call centres and web portals being cheaper than individual customer
interactions) [<a href="#2.1.2">2.1.2</a>]. In the care context it is
similar but there is also a desire to create a society that functions at
large without individuals requiring special handling and support [<a href="#3.4.1">3.4.1OLD</a>]. Both case studies’ findings, consistent
with literature <span class="citation" data-cites="abiteboul2015 crabtree2016">(<a href="#ref-abiteboul2015" role="doc-biblioref">Abiteboul, André and Kaplan, 2015</a>; <a href="#ref-crabtree2016" role="doc-biblioref">Crabtree and Mortier,
2016</a>)</span>, reveal myriad problems created by the exclusion [PS]
of people from matters that affect them - from feelings of alienation or
disengagement [<a href="#5.4.4.1">5.4.4</a>] to actual harms caused by
erroneous or unfair judgements [<a href="#4.2.2">4.2.2</a>]. Service
providers holding data need to contextualise data as an incomplete view
into the complex human world, and seek greater understanding [<a href="#4.3.4.2">4.3.4</a>] while looking for positives in data [<a href="#4.3.4.1">4.3.4</a>]. It is interesting to note that the Troubled
Families programme was created help find the human situations of people
slipping through the cracks of the system. This highlights the
inadequacy of purely data-based decision making [<a href="#3.4.1">3.4.1OLD</a>].</p>
<p><strong>Consent to access and use data needs to be dynamic and
meaningful, which can only happen through ongoing involvement.</strong>
As established in <a href="#4.4.1">4.4.1</a> and <a href="#6.2.2">6.2.2</a>, ongoing data consent is essential, and this is
especially important where that data is used to make decisions [<a href="#4.4.3">4.4.3</a>]. One-time consent is ineffective and
meaningless [<a href="#4.5">4.5</a>]. Asking individuals for consent and
subsequently less involved in decision making reinforces a hierarchical,
rather than an equitable, power relationship <span class="citation" data-cites="bakardjieva2001">(<a href="#ref-bakardjieva2001" role="doc-biblioref">Bakardjieva and Feenberg, 2001</a>)</span>. Without
ongoing consent, the power imbalance is amplified [<a href="#4.5">4.5</a>]. In the commercial context, companies view data as
their asset to exploit <span class="citation" data-cites="wef2011 toonders2014">(<a href="#ref-wef2011" role="doc-biblioref">Hoffman, 2011</a>; <a href="#ref-toonders2014" role="doc-biblioref">Toonders, 2014</a>)</span>, and the simple fact of
having the ability to collect or access to data about people has proved
in practice, sufficient to enable a variety of practices which would be
likely to be refused consent if made visible to users <span class="citation" data-cites="evans2021 claburn2021 melendez2019">(<a href="#ref-melendez2019" role="doc-biblioref">Melendez and Pasternack,

<a href="#ref-claburn2021" role="doc-biblioref">Claburn,
2021</a>)</span>. Individuals feel forced into a one-sided arrangement
of sacrificing data in exchange for service benefits; with no choice
upfront on signup, and minimal practical choices afterwards, their only
choice is Hobson’s choice <span class="citation" data-cites="britannicaHobsonsChoice">(<a href="#ref-britannicaHobsonsChoice" role="doc-biblioref"><span>‘<span class="nocase">Hobson’s Choice</span>’</span>, no date</a>)</span>.
Consent has become commoditised, and from a corporate perspective the
focus has become constructing a <em>legal justification</em> for using
an individual’s data rather than practically engaging with them and
verifying if they approve <span class="citation" data-cites="woods2022">(<a href="#ref-woods2022" role="doc-biblioref">Woods, 2022</a>)</span>. This can only happen when
the individual about which data is held is excluded from data handling
processes.</p>
<p><strong>A human channel for conversation is wanted, to enable
explanations, questions, and consultation</strong>. In PS and CS1, all
participants viewed that individuals should be able to talk to someone
about their data [<a href="#4.2.6">4.2.6</a>; <a href="#4.3.2.4">4.3.2</a>], in order to ask questions or explain
datapoints. In CS2, participants had questions about their data that
they wanted to answer [<a href="#5.3.3">5.3.3</a>], yet these questions
remained unanswered [<a href="#5.4.2.3">5.4.2</a>]. Participants
regularly experienced painful and ineffective processes when trying to
answer their questions, found that GDPR responses, often unhelpful,
provided no backchannel for follow-up questions or further communication
[<a href="#5.2.4.3">5.4.2</a>]. They were left <em>‘in the dark’</em>.
This highlights the need for a human support channel, which is not
mandated by GDPR, not just to better understand the data itself [<a href="#6.1.2">6.1.2</a>], but to enable ongoing consent negotiation
within the relationship with data holders.</p>
<p><strong>Individuals should be consulted in decision making. This
improves accuracy, perspective, and fairness and reduces consent
liability.</strong> A common theme in the findings of both PS and CS1
was the idea that data is more likely to be fair and accurate if in the
individual has the opportunity to express their perspective on it.
Families advocated checking data together to identify gaps [<a href="#4.3.3.2">4.3.3</a>], valued the prospect of making their own
contributions to the data to <em>‘tell their own story’</em> [<a href="#4.3.3.4">4.3.3</a>] and wanted a <em>‘right to explain’</em> or
annotate their data [PS]. Support workers recognised the need to work
with families to understand their situation better [<a href="#4.3.2.2">4.3.2</a>]. These findings show it is important to give
the human data subject a role in data creation or checking, and that if
they are involved, to ensure a fairer and more complete view can be
obtained than the limited view presented by the data record [<a href="#4.3.3.1">4.3.3</a>]. Without involvement, agency <span class="citation" data-cites="mortier2014">(<a href="#ref-mortier2014" role="doc-biblioref">Mortier <em>et al.</em>, 2014</a>)</span> will
always be limited. Data is not neutral <span class="citation" data-cites="gitelman2013 neff2013">(<a href="#ref-gitelman2013" role="doc-biblioref">Gitelman, 2013</a>; <a href="#ref-neff2013" role="doc-biblioref">Neff, 2013</a>)</span>, and this means all
stakeholders should be given a role <span class="citation" data-cites="bowker2005">(<a href="#ref-bowker2005" role="doc-biblioref">Bowker, 2005</a>)</span> in order to avoid errors,
harm or disempowerment [<a href="#4.4.1">4.4.1</a>]. Involvement is
negligible in the care context (being limited to the TAF and the support
worker relationship). In the commercial context, there is no such
involvement, and the results of this can be seen in the low accuracy of
previously unseen data [<a href="#5.3.3">5.3.3</a>] and in the low trust
ratings [<a href="#5.3.4">5.3.4</a>] given to many providers after
seeing data returns. It seems that data and knowledge would become more
accurate when it is closer the data is to the individuals concerned [<a href="#4.4.3">4.4.3</a>; <a href="#4.5">4.5</a>]. Data created and
handled far from the family would intuitively be less accurate and less
likely to have been considered from their perspective [<a href="#4.2.2">4.2.2</a>]. Organisations on both sides value data
accuracy [<a href="#4.2.3">4.2.3</a>; <a href="#2.1.2">2.1.2</a>] so
greater involvement could help achieve this. Data holders would also
benefit from involving individuals because responsibility for consent
would become shared, resulting in a higher ‘buy-in’ from individuals and
a reduced liability. Provided communication is effective and without
barriers, involved individuals would be inclined to speak up if they see
something they do not agree with [<a href="#4.4.1">4.4.1</a>]. Of
course, this call for involvement in decision making is not absolute.
Businesses need to be free to exercise their expertise. Patients are not
best placed to decide what medicines they need, and over-involvement of
users in product design can result in mediocre products that suffer from
<em>design by committee</em>. In fact, the attitude conveyed toward the
individual is critical, This was borne out in CS2 findings [<a href="#5.4.4.2">5.4.4</a>; <a href="#5.4.4.3">5.4.4</a>]. Edwards and
Elwyn, in their paper on shared decision making, argue that
<em>feeling</em> involved is actually more important that actually
contributing to decisions <span class="citation" data-cites="edwards2006">(<a href="#ref-edwards2006" role="doc-biblioref">Edwards and Elwyn, 2006</a>)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Effective collaboration can be achieved by coming together
around the data, using it as evidence (of facts or of opinions) and as a
boundary object.</strong> Workshop C in CS1 specifically explored the
prospects of shared data interaction, which had emerged from SILVER and
phase 1 (Workshop A/B [<a href="#4.2.5">4.2.5</a>]) findings as a
possible way to meet the needs of both supported families and support
workers. Shared values were identified [<a href="#4.2.6">4.2.6</a>] and
a model for shared data interaction builds upon the findings [<a href="#4.4.3">4.4.3</a>]. Central to this is the idea that
evidence-based decision making can be more effective (both from a
rapport-building perspective but also in terms of the quality of
decision made) as guidance has advised [<span class="citation" data-cites="ofsted2015">OFSTED (<a href="#ref-ofsted2015" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span>; <span class="citation" data-cites="dfe2018">Department for Education (<a href="#ref-dfe2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>; <a href="#4.1.2">4.1.2</a>] and
as seen in the findings [<a href="#4.3.2.2">4.3.2</a>; <a href="#4.3.3">4.3.3</a>; <a href="#4.4.1">4.4.1</a>]. Families and staff
saw potential benefits from checking data together [<a href="#4.3.3.2">4.3.3</a>], using specific datapoints in discussions as
evidence [<a href="#4.3.2.2">4.3.2</a>], or to help families open up [<a href="#4.4.2">4.4.2</a>], on top of the simple benefits of making all
evidence equally visible [<a href="#4.3.2.2">4.3.2</a>; <a href="#6.1.1">6.1.1</a>]. Throughout such shared data interactions,
representations of data perform an important function as a boundary
object <span class="citation" data-cites="star2010 bowker2016">(<a href="#ref-star2010" role="doc-biblioref">Star, 2010</a>; <a href="#ref-bowker2016" role="doc-biblioref">Bowker <em>et al.</em>,
2015</a>)</span>; it provides a common focus to discussions that is
relatable to both parties, <em>things to think with</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="papert1980 brandt2004">(<a href="#ref-papert1980" role="doc-biblioref">Papert, 1980</a>; <a href="#ref-brandt2004" role="doc-biblioref">Brandt and Messeter,
2004</a>)</span>. This helps improve legibility by surfacing the
(perfectly valid) differences in different parties’ perspectives <span class="citation" data-cites="mortier2014">(6.1.2, <a href="#ref-mortier2014" role="doc-biblioref">Mortier <em>et al.</em>,
2014</a>)</span>. In PS I observed that gathering around data
representations facilitated a less confrontational interaction than an
across-the-table interview would.</p>
<p><strong>Being involved means being able to learn and take action at
any time, including on one’s own and away from official contact or
interactions with service representatives.</strong> Both Case Studies
reveal that people want an ongoing window into their data and its use.
Limiting data access and process transparency to specific times spent
with a gatekeeper, as in the EH case [<a href="#4.1.1">4.1.1</a>], or to
a process that only provides a one-time snapshot of data [<a href="#5.5.1">5.5.1</a>] reinforces the hierarchical power imbalance.
Giving access to data and abilities to explore and ask questions <em>‘in
your own time’</em> [<a href="#4.3.2.4">4.3.2</a>] can unlock new
individual benefits from data [<a href="#5.4.3.2">5.4.3</a>; <a href="#6.1.3">6.1.3</a>] and provide more immediate feedback that can
help people measure their progress towards improvement goals [<a href="#2.2.3">2.2.3</a>; <a href="#4.4.2">4.4.2</a>; <a href="#4.4.3">4.4.3</a>], as well as enabling ongoing individual
oversight [<a href="#4.4.2">4.4.2</a>] and dynamic consent [<a href="#4.3.4.3">4.3.4</a>]. In the face of providers making decisions
based on unseen data using processes that cannot be observed, people
feel excluded and powerless [<a href="#5.4.4.1">5.4.4</a>; <a href="#6.1.1">6.1.1</a>]. To ensure effective access <span class="citation" data-cites="gurstein2011">(<a href="#ref-gurstein2011" role="doc-biblioref">Gurstein, 2011</a>)</span>, accountability and
trust, there must be ongoing involvement, data access and transparency
[<a href="#5.5.1">5.5.1</a>; <a href="#6.2.2">6.2.2</a>].</p>
<p><strong>Indirect data use enforces an uneasy trust; services that use
data need a human face or point of contact, in order to grow
understanding, earn trust and improve relations.</strong> There is a
coldness to data. Facts, judgments and mistakes appear in print with
equal weight, without explanation or context, seemingly a complete set
of objective facts. In both studies, the value of human contact
accompanying data access was evident; in CS2 participants valued the
GDPR responses that felt most human [<a href="#5.4.4.3">5.4.4</a>] and
lamented the inability to discuss data or resolve questions [<a href="#5.3.3">5.3.3</a>; <a href="#5.4.2.3">5.4.2</a>]. In PS
participants wanted <em>‘to have a conversation’</em> about their data
and in CS1 participant data interface designs included buttons to chat
to their support worker or ask questions [<a href="#4.3.2.3">4.3.2</a>].
People do not want to be severed or alienated from their data, yet they
feel they have no choice but to relinquish access and involvement [<a href="#4.4.2">4.4.2</a>; <a href="#5.4.4.1">5.4.4</a>]. Ideally, all
data-using organisations would have a human face or point of contact
that individuals can address questions to and in whom their trust of the
organisation can be embodied [<a href="#4.4.2">4.4.2</a>].</p>
<p><strong>Without involvement, people cannot take a full and equitable
role in processes that affect their life.</strong> When data is used by
organisations, this inherently serves as a proxy for their involvement
[PS; <a href="#5.4.4.1">5.4.4</a>]. People have consequently lost
control and agency <span class="citation" data-cites="crabtree2016">(<a href="#ref-crabtree2016" role="doc-biblioref">Crabtree and Mortier,
2016</a>)</span>, creating a crisis of trust and a power imbalance <span class="citation" data-cites="wef2014lens wef2014context">(<a href="#ref-wef2014lens" role="doc-biblioref">Hoffman, 2014a</a>, <a href="#ref-wef2014context" role="doc-biblioref">2014b</a>)</span>.
Exclusion from data handling and decision making inevitably reinforces a
hierarchy, with the individual destined to have less say and influence
over services that affect their daily lives. Taken together, an ongoing
involvement with the data held by service providers and the processes
that use that data would change indirect data interaction [<a href="#6.2">6.2</a>] into direct data interaction [<a href="#6.1">6.1</a>] and transform the individual experience of service
use. Of course such a shift is difficult and costly to offer, for both
small and large companies—the data-centric world emerged in part as a
means to reduce costly human interactions and facilitate large-scale
scaling up to serve larger user bases—but what we see suggests that the
balance has tipped too far towards exclusion of individuals, and that
giving them even a limited role in reviewing data, consenting and
contributing to decisions, and just being informed, could carry
significant benefits for both individual empowerment and organisational
reputation, and trust.</p>
<h2 data-number="6.3" id="6.3"><span class="header-section-number">6.3</span> Summation: Empowering
Individuals with Better Data Relations</h2>
<p>In this chapter, the separate Case Study findings and insights from
Chapters <a href="#chapter-4">4</a> and <a href="#chapter-5">5</a> have
been synthesised to identify six specific capabilities that people need
in their relationship with their personal data - both from the direct
perspective of RQ1 [<a href="#RQ1">3.3.1</a>], where people want for
<strong>visible, understandable and useable<sup><a href="#fn10">10</a></sup> data</strong>, and from the indirect
perspective of RQ2 [<a href="#RQ2">3.3.2</a>], where people want for
<strong>process transparency, individual oversight and decision-making
involvement</strong>.</p>
<h3 data-number="6.3.1" id="6.3.1"><span class="header-section-number">6.3.1</span> Empowerment</h3>
<p>In line with the pragmatist, individualist outlook of this thesis [<a href="#3.1">3.1</a>], these six wants amount to <strong>a desire for
empowerment</strong>, motivated by a desire to pursue one’s own
happiness and self-interest. Empowerment is defined as <em>‘the process
of gaining freedom and power to do what you want or to control what
happens to you’</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="dictEmpowerment">(<a href="#ref-dictEmpowerment" role="doc-biblioref">Cambridge Dictionary, no date</a>)</span>. In
essence, empowerment is achieved when the individual, in consideration
of the question <em>‘what can I do?’</em>, judges that they can do more.
Power, it transpires, is a double-edged concept. The power imbalance
over personal data [<a href="#2.1.2">2.1.2</a>] encompasses both
<em>power to</em> but also the concept of <em>power over</em>. These are
best considered as two sides of the same coin or two perspectives on the
same set of facts: organisations have <em>social power</em> over
individuals, that affects what both parties can do. An organisation
having social power does not imply a desire to dominate. Impacts on the
individual’s agency are merely material effects of the power holder’s
attempts to influence the behaviour of individuals in pursuit of the
power holder’s own desired outcomes <span class="citation" data-cites="pansardi2012">(<a href="#ref-pansardi2012" role="doc-biblioref">Pansardi, 2012</a>)</span>. Concepts of power are
explored further in <a href="#8.4.1">8.4.1</a>.</p>
<h3 data-number="6.3.2" id="6.3.2"><span class="header-section-number">6.3.2</span> Disempowerment</h3>
<p>Not only do these six wants lead to individual empowerment, there is
a clear correlation. <strong>The more that the six data wants can be
addressed, the more empowering it is to individuals.</strong> From the
Case Studies it is clear that the status quo of the data-centric world
[<a href="#2.1">2.1</a>] is that the lack of these six capabilities
reduces individual capacity to act, individuals are
<strong>disempowered</strong>. People are treated indirectly through
data <span class="citation" data-cites="cornford2013">(<a href="#ref-cornford2013" role="doc-biblioref">Cornford, Baines and
Wilson, 2013</a>)</span>. They are excluded and not involved [<a href="#4.5">4.5</a>; <a href="#5.4.2.1">5.4.2</a>; <a href="#5.4.3.3">5.4.3</a>; <a href="#5.4.4.1">5.4.4</a>]. In both Case
Studies many of the findings are based on the opinions of participants
as to what they believe <em>would</em> be desirable, preferable or more
successful. In the case of data visibility [<a href="#6.1.3">6.1.3</a>]
and process transparency [<a href="#6.2.1">6.2.1</a>], however, there is
clear evidence that these <em>do</em> have an impact on individual’s
subjective assessment of their own empowerment: In CS2, 45% of cases saw
people experience a change in power after examining privacy policies and
scrutinising GDPR responses. 29% felt a decrease in power, and 17% an
increase. Data visibility and process transparency seem to be key first
steps towards empowerment, as they allow a more accurate assessment of
one’s own capability. In 52% of cases, CS2 participants felt more
distrustful, having discovered unsatisfactory exertions of power by
providers [<a href="#5.3.4">5.3.4</a>]. Once visibility and transparency
have been achieved, it is clear that this should be followed soon after
with understanding [<a href="#6.1.1">6.1.1</a>], agency [<a href="#6.1.3">6.1.3</a>; <a href="#6.2.2">6.2.2</a>] and involvement [<a href="#6.2.3">6.2.3</a>]. Any one of the six wants can improve data
relations for the individual, but the combination of all six is likely
to produce more than the sum of its parts—an empowered digital
citizen.</p>
<h3 data-number="6.3.3" id="6.3.3"><span class="header-section-number">6.3.3</span> Towards A Better Society</h3>
<p>Considering the societal level, these six wants show <strong>how
society should be reconfigured to improve data relations</strong>.
Giving people a role in influencing the life of their own data is a key
ingredient in and of more progressive digital citizenship <span class="citation" data-cites="bridle2016">(<a href="#ref-bridle2016" role="doc-biblioref">Bridle, 2016</a>)</span>. Shifting data interaction
interfaces and processes to a more human-centric [<a href="#2.3">2.3</a>] model where people are controllers at the centre of
their own personal data ecosystem [<a href="#2.3.4">2.3.4</a>] would be
progressive and transformative, and not without cost, education,
deployment and uptake challenges. Nonetheles, participants in both
Studies could easily imagine more human-centric interfaces and more
empowering service interactions, and demanded those improvements. And it
is possible. Just as some human-centric practices were beginning to
emerge among support services in CS1 [<a href="#4.3.1">4.3.1</a>], so
some companies targeted in CS2 are already beginning to move in this
direction. Some offer privacy hubs and explanations of data practices,
while others offer interfaces solely for accessing data and exerting
data rights [<a href="#5.1.1">5.1.1</a>]. In both Case Studies, there
was a clear demand for these initial forays by service providers to be
expanded: be it through more pro-active data practices in the care
context [<a href="#4.3.4.3">4.3.4</a>], or through new models of data
involvement in the commercial context [<a href="#5.5.2">5.5.2</a>]. If
the locus of decision making [<a href="#4.4.3">4.4.3</a>] could be
shifted towards individuals through such reconfigurations of existing
practices, this would give them a role to play as <em>agents in the life
of their own data</em>. This would allow them to curate their own data
self, the representation of them used in decision making, so that it is
fair, accurate and representative [PS; <a href="#4.4.3">4.4.3</a>]. The
principles of involvement, effective access and shared data interaction
could be applied in many domains - education, health, democracy and
commerce, and an emphasis on individual sociotechnical capabilities is a
useful mindset to apply to both business process design and data
interface design.</p>
<p><strong>Empowering individuals with better data relations should lead
to a better future.</strong> Taken together, the pursuit of the six data
wants allow us to envisage a new, data-empowered future for individuals,
who would reap the benefits of being able to gain insights and feedback
from their own data in real time, while also co-operating with service
providers in the stewardship of their data and involved in decisions.
They would have agency, influence and negotiability in an ongoing
manner. In this future, there are opportunities for organisations to
reimagine customer relations and the role of data in service provision,
leading to increased accuracy and consent, reduced liability, greater
trust and loyalty [<a href="#5.5.2">5.5.2</a>], and potentially to
capitalise on new demands for data insight tools [<a href="#5.5.3">5.5.3</a>]. The ideal is that individuals would have a
<em>‘permanently open two-way communication channel [with data holders],
allowing a dialogue to take place’</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="bakardjieva2001">(<a href="#ref-bakardjieva2001" role="doc-biblioref">Bakardjieva and Feenberg, 2001</a>)</span>,
delivering dynamic consent and ongoing involvement. Such a change in
thinking, away from legal box-ticking (be it capturing informed consent
[<a href="#4.1.2">4.1.2</a>], or satisfying GDPR requests [<a href="#5.5.1">5.5.1</a>]) and towards delivering an ongoing
understanding of the collection and use of one’s data and a voice in
what happens to it, would empower individuals and begin to move us
towards that idealised future. In such a society, the positive impacts
of transparency would be evident. The general principle that
transparency allows trust to be earned (which can in turn benefit
organisations themselves) could be applied in a wide range of service
endeavours that are currently very closed. This would allow innovation
in data access and process involvement to flourish.</p>
<p>The vision of these new empowered individuals, given new inclusive
roles in the lives of their data, therefore, is the ultimate answer to
the research question [<a href="#RQ">2.4</a>] Part One of this thesis
set out to answer: This data-empowered and process-involved future is
what better data relatioins would look like.</p>
